# Figma AI Ticket Generator - AI Assistant Rules

## MANDATORY CONTEXT FILES TO READ FIRST:
1. .ai-context-rules.md - AI behavioral rules and file placement protocol
2. docs/MASTER_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md - Current project status (Phase 6 Complete)
3. docs/project-phases/MASTER_FUTURE_PLAN.md - Strategic roadmap (Phases 7-10)

## PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Phase 6 Complete: Advanced Template System with 7 platforms
- Documentation: 75% consolidation complete across all docs/ subdirectories  
- Architecture: MCP Server + Plugin UI (localhost:3000) - NEVER direct Figma API
- Next Focus: Phase 7 Live Integration & Market Validation
- Key Differentiator: Deep Design Intelligence extraction

## CRITICAL RULES:
- ALL .md files MUST go in docs/[category]/ subdirectories
- Test files: tests/[type]/ or ui/test/ for HTML
- ALWAYS check project structure before creating files
- USE MCP server architecture, never direct Figma API

## FILE CREATION CHECKLIST:
1. Check current working directory (pwd)
2. List project structure (list_dir)
3. Determine correct location for file type
4. Verify target directory exists
5. Ask user if uncertain

## CURRENT STATUS:
Production-ready Figma plugin with comprehensive template system, consolidated documentation structure, ready for live market testing and design intelligence enhancement.

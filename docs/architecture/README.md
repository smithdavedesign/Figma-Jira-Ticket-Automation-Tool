## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Quick Reference

### **Core Architecture Pattern**
- **MVC Structure**: Controllers (app/) + Models (core/) + Views (ui/) + Configuration (config/)
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server on localhost:3000
- **Redis Integration**: Persistent caching with graceful fallback
- **AI Orchestration**: Multi-provider AI integration (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude)

### **Key Integration Points**
1. **Plugin UI ‚Üî MCP Server**: HTTP API with JSON payloads
2. **MCP Server ‚Üî AI Services**: Secure multi-provider integration
3. **MCP Server ‚Üî Redis**: High-performance caching layer
4. **MCP Server ‚Üî Figma API**: Secure token-based integration

### **Production Features**
- **6 MCP Business Tools**: Production-ready business logic
- **Enterprise Caching**: Redis with 50-80% performance improvement
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with performance tracking
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time system status and metrics

## üîÑ Maintenance Protocol
- Update this README when adding/modifying any architecture document
- Check existing architecture docs before creating new ones to avoid duplication
- Consider consolidation opportunities when adding new technical documentation
- Maintain consistency across all architecture documentation

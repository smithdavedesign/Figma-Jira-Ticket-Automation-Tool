## üìã **CORE ARCHITECTURE GUIDES**

This directory contains **3 comprehensive architecture guides** covering all aspects of the system design:

### **1. ÔøΩÔ∏è COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**
**File:** `COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`  
**Scope:** Complete system architecture overview with strategic design decisions  
**Coverage:**
- MVC Architecture Deep Dive (Controllers, Models, Views)
- System Integration Architecture (request flow, AI orchestration)
- Data Architecture (caching, Redis integration, fallback strategies)
- Strategic Asset Preservation (Phase 7 & 11 ready components)
- Performance Architecture (metrics, optimization strategies)
- Security and Deployment Architecture

### **2. üß† AI INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE**  
**File:** `AI_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`  
**Scope:** AI orchestration, multi-provider integration, and intelligence processing  
**Coverage:**
- Multi-AI provider orchestration patterns
- Intelligent routing and fallback chains
- AI model configuration and management
- Visual Enhanced AI Service architecture

- Performance optimization and caching strategies

### **3. üîÑ MIGRATION HISTORY**
**File:** `MIGRATION_HISTORY.md`  
**Scope:** Architectural evolution, migration strategies, and optimization decisions  
**Coverage:**
- TypeScript to JavaScript migration (86 files converted)

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Quick Reference

### **Core Architecture Pattern**
- **MVC Structure**: Controllers (app/) + Models (core/) + Views (ui/) + Configuration (config/)
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server on localhost:3000
- **Redis Integration**: Persistent caching with graceful fallback
- **AI Orchestration**: Multi-provider AI integration (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude)

### **Key Integration Points**
1. **Plugin UI ‚Üî MCP Server**: HTTP API with JSON payloads
2. **MCP Server ‚Üî AI Services**: Secure multi-provider integration
3. **MCP Server ‚Üî Redis**: High-performance caching layer
4. **MCP Server ‚Üî Figma API**: Secure token-based integration

### **Production Features**
- **6 MCP Business Tools**: Production-ready business logic
- **Enterprise Caching**: Redis with 50-80% performance improvement
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with performance tracking
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time system status and metrics

## üîÑ Maintenance Protocol
- Update this README when adding/modifying any architecture document
- Check existing architecture docs before creating new ones to avoid duplication
- Consider consolidation opportunities when adding new technical documentation
- Maintain consistency across all architecture documentation

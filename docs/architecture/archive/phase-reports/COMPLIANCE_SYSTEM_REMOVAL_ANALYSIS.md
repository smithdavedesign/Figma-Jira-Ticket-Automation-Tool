- **Component Density Analysis**: Statistical analysis of component distribution across pages
- **Token Categorization**: Automatic classification (primary/secondary colors, heading/body typography)
- **Component Classification**: Smart categorization (buttons, forms, cards, overlays, navigation)

#### **Performance Optimizations:**
- **Timeout Protection**: 10-second maximum scan duration to prevent UI freezing
- **Incremental Analysis**: Staged scanning with early termination on timeout
- **Efficient Tree Traversal**: Optimized recursive node scanning algorithms

#### **Data Structure Generation:**
```javascript
// Comprehensive DesignSystem Object:
{
  id: "ds_timestamp_hash",
  name: "Derived Design System Name",
  pages: [...], // Design system pages with confidence scores
  colors: [...], // Color tokens with RGB values and categories
  typography: [...], // Typography tokens with font families and sizes
  components: {...}, // Component library with categories and counts
  spacing: [...], // Spacing tokens (4px grid system)
  effects: [...], // Effect tokens (shadows, blurs, glows)
  detectionConfidence: 0.85 // Overall confidence score
}
```

### **4. core/template/template-types.js (3KB) - FILE NOT FOUND**

#### **Status:** File does not exist in current filesystem
- **Expected Functionality**: Type definitions for template system
- **Impact**: No impact from removal since file is already missing
- **Action**: No removal needed - already cleaned up

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **‚úÖ SAFE FOR REMOVAL - Reasons:**

#### **1. Experimental/Legacy Status:**
- **No Production Integration**: These compliance features are not integrated into current MCP server tools
- **Standalone Systems**: No active imports or usage in current production codebase
- **Alternative Coverage**: Core functionality available through other channels

#### **2. No Active Dependencies:**
- **Import Analysis**: Zero imports of these modules in active codebase
- **API Integration**: Current MCP tools operate independently of compliance system
- **UI Integration**: No UI components actively use these compliance features

#### **3. Alternative Functionality Available:**
- **Design System Analysis**: Available through `project-analyzer.js` MCP tool
- **Component Validation**: Handled by current template and extraction systems
- **Quality Assurance**: Covered by existing test suites and validation systems

### **‚ö†Ô∏è FUNCTIONALITY LOSS ANALYSIS:**

#### **Features That Will Become Unavailable:**
1. **Automated Compliance Scoring**: Real-time design system adherence percentage calculation
2. **Multi-System Recognition**: Automatic Material/Ant/Fluent design system pattern matching
3. **Component Pattern Validation**: Automated button/input/card component compliance checking
4. **Design System Auto-Discovery**: Automatic scanning and cataloging of design systems in Figma files
5. **Token Extraction Automation**: Automated color/typography/spacing token extraction from Figma styles
6. **Tech Stack Compatibility Assessment**: Framework compatibility scoring for design systems

#### **Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Manual Analysis**: Design system analysis can be performed manually through Figma
- **MCP Tool Coverage**: Core project analysis available through existing MCP tools
- **Future Implementation**: Features can be re-implemented if needed with current architecture
- **Alternative Tools**: Third-party design system analysis tools available

### **üí° BUSINESS IMPACT:**
- **Development Speed**: Minimal impact - compliance features were not actively used
- **Quality Assurance**: Core quality maintained through existing test suites
- **Design System Adoption**: Manual design system management still fully functional
- **Code Maintenance**: Reduced complexity and maintenance burden

## üöÄ **REMOVAL RECOMMENDATION**

### **‚úÖ PROCEED WITH REMOVAL**

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (90%)

**Justification:**
1. **Zero Active Usage**: No imports or references in current production system
2. **Experimental Status**: Features were never fully integrated into production workflow
3. **Alternative Coverage**: Core needs met by existing MCP tools and manual processes
4. **Maintenance Reduction**: Eliminates 35KB of unmaintained experimental code
5. **Architecture Clarity**: Removes unused complexity from core system

### **üìã RECOMMENDED REMOVAL COMMANDS:**
```bash
# Safe to remove - Experimental compliance system (35KB total)
rm -rf core/compliance/                    # 20KB - Compliance analysis system
rm -rf core/design-system/                 # 15KB - Design system scanner
rm core/template/template-types.js         # 3KB - Type definitions (if exists)
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è POST-REMOVAL VALIDATION:**
1. **Test MCP Server**: Ensure all 6 production tools remain functional
2. **Validate Build**: Confirm no missing import errors
3. **Test Template System**: Verify template generation still works
4. **Check Project Analysis**: Ensure project-analyzer.js covers design analysis needs

### **üîÑ FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:**
If design system compliance features are needed in the future:
1. **Integration Strategy**: Implement as MCP server tool for better architecture
2. **Simplified Approach**: Focus on specific compliance needs rather than comprehensive scanning
3. **Performance First**: Implement with timeout protections and incremental analysis
4. **User-Driven**: Make compliance analysis optional user-triggered feature

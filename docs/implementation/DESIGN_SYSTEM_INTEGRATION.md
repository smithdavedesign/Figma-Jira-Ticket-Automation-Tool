# 🎨 Design System Integration Feature

## Overview

The Design System Integration feature automatically detects and analyzes design systems within Figma files to provide compliance checking, component suggestions, and enhanced ticket generation with design system context.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically find and catalog design system resources in Figma files
- **Compliance Checking**: Flag deviations from established design patterns
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommend existing components and styles instead of creating new ones
- **Enhanced Context**: Include design system information in generated tickets

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Phase 1: Auto-Discovery Engine (Current Branch)

#### Core Components

1. **Design System Scanner** (`DesignSystemScanner`)
   - Scans all pages for design system indicators
   - Collects published styles (colors, typography, effects)
   - Maps component relationships and variants
   - Identifies design system pages/libraries

2. **Compliance Analyzer** (`ComplianceAnalyzer`)
   - Compares selected frames against design system
   - Detects style inconsistencies (hardcoded vs. token usage)
   - Scores compliance percentage
   - Generates actionable recommendations

3. **Enhanced Frame Extractor** (`FrameExtractor`)
   - Extends existing frame analysis
   - Includes design system context
   - Maps used styles to design system tokens
   - Identifies component usage patterns

#### Detection Strategies

**Page-Level Detection:**
- Look for pages named: "Design System", "Components", "Tokens", "Styles", "Library"
- Scan for high concentration of published components
- Detect style guide layouts and documentation patterns

**Style Library Analysis:**
- Collect all published local styles (paint, text, effect)
- Analyze style naming conventions
- Build style taxonomy and relationships

**Component Analysis:**
- Map all component instances to their masters
- Identify component variants and properties
- Detect component usage patterns

## 📊 Data Structures

### DesignSystem Interface
```typescript
interface DesignSystem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  pages: DesignSystemPage[];
  colors: ColorToken[];
  typography: TypographyToken[];
  components: ComponentLibrary;
  spacing: SpacingToken[];
  effects: EffectToken[];
  detectionConfidence: number; // 0-1 score
}
```

### ComplianceReport Interface
```typescript
interface ComplianceReport {
  overallScore: number; // 0-100 percentage
  colorCompliance: ColorCompliance;
  typographyCompliance: TypographyCompliance;
  componentCompliance: ComponentCompliance;
  recommendations: Recommendation[];
  usedTokens: Token[];
  violations: Violation[];
}
```

## 🔍 Detection Algorithms

### 1. Design System Page Detection
```
Algorithm: Page Content Analysis
1. Scan all pages in the file
2. Check page names against known patterns
3. Analyze page content for design system indicators:
   - High component density
   - Style documentation patterns
   - Token organization layouts
4. Score each page for design system likelihood
5. Select highest scoring pages as design system sources
```

### 2. Style Token Extraction
```
Algorithm: Published Style Analysis
1. Collect all published paint styles
2. Parse style names for token patterns:
   - Primary/Secondary/Tertiary
   - Semantic naming (error, warning, success)
   - Scale patterns (100, 200, 300...)
3. Build style hierarchy and relationships
4. Create token map for compliance checking
```

### 3. Component Library Mapping
```
Algorithm: Component Relationship Analysis
1. Find all component masters in the file
2. Map instance relationships and variants
3. Analyze naming conventions and organization
4. Build component taxonomy tree
5. Identify reusable vs. one-off components
```

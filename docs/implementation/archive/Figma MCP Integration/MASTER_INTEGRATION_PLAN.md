# 🎯 Figma MCP Smart Parser Integration - Master Plan

## **Project Overview**
Integrate our sophisticated tech stack parser with Figma MCP for automated design-to-code generation through a structured 4-phase approach.

## **Current Foundation (✅ Completed)**
- ✅ **Security**: API key exposure resolved, new validated Gemini key operational
- ✅ **Smart Parser**: Sophisticated tech stack interface with suggestion pills & AI confidence scoring
- ✅ **MCP Server**: Running successfully on localhost:3000 with enhanced ticket generation
- ✅ **AI Integration**: Gemini generating React/TypeScript boilerplate + comprehensive tickets
- ✅ **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when Figma MCP unavailable

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Enhanced Smart Parser Flow**
```javascript
// Phase 1: Enhanced tech stack parsing with Figma context
const enhancedParseTechStack = async (input, figmaContext) => {
  const baseStack = parseTechStack(input);
  const designPatterns = analyzeDesignPatterns(figmaContext);
  const componentTypes = detectComponentTypes(figmaContext);
  
  return {
    ...baseStack,
    designContext: {
      patterns: designPatterns,
      components: componentTypes,
      confidence: calculateDesignConfidence(baseStack, figmaContext)
    }
  };
};
```

### **Integration Pipeline**
```
Phase 1: UI Smart Parser → Enhanced Analysis
Phase 2: Enhanced Analysis → Figma MCP Server  
Phase 3: Figma MCP Server → Framework-Specific Code Generation
Phase 4: Code Generation → Automated Workflow & Build Integration
```

# 🎉 Express Integration & Live Monitoring - COMPLETE!

## ✅ Implementation Summary

We have successfully transformed the Figma MCP Server with comprehensive Express.js integration and advanced live test monitoring capabilities. Here's what was accomplished:

### 🌐 Express Framework Integration
- **Complete Migration**: Converted from basic HTTP server to full Express.js framework
- **Comprehensive Middleware**: Implemented request logging, error handling, and performance monitoring
- **API Endpoints**: Added REST API endpoints for test management and system monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Integrated system health monitoring with detailed metrics

### 🔄 Live Test Monitoring System
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time test execution updates on port 8102
- **File Watchers**: Auto-rerun tests on code changes with intelligent suite detection
- **Coverage Tracking**: Real-time test coverage metrics and visualization
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Beautiful web interface with live updates and controls

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **Fixed UI Tabs**: Resolved broken tab navigation in test suite by fixing event parameter passing
- **Method Binding**: Fixed invalid method binding error in live test monitor
- **Dependency Management**: Added missing `node-fetch` dependency
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error boundaries and graceful failure handling

# üöÄ Production Readiness Checklist

This document outlines key areas to review and improve before deploying the Figma AI Ticket Generator to production environments.

## üîê Security & Privacy

### 1. API Key Handling
- **Current State**: Stored in localStorage with basic error handling
- **Recommendations**:
  - Add clear warning that API keys are stored locally only
  - Include explicit text about data not being sent to external servers (except OpenAI)
  - Add option to clear/delete stored API key
  - Consider adding API key format validation before requests

### 2. Network Access
- **Current State**: Only OpenAI domain whitelisted ‚úÖ
- **Recommendations**:
  - Add comprehensive error handling for network failures
  - Implement graceful degradation when offline

## üöÄ Performance & Reliability

### 3. Error Handling
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Add timeout handling for OpenAI API calls (currently no timeout set)
  - Implement retry logic for API rate limiting (429 errors)
  - Add validation for malformed frame data
  - Better error messages for common failure scenarios

### 4. Memory Management
- **Potential Issues**:
  - Large selections could cause memory issues in `extractFrameData`
  - No limit on number of frames processed simultaneously
- **Recommendations**:
  - Consider limiting frames processed at once (e.g., max 10-20)
  - Add progress indicators for large operations
  - Implement streaming processing for very large selections

## üé® User Experience

### 5. Loading States & Feedback
- **Current State**: Basic loading messages
- **Improvements Needed**:
  - Add progress bars for ticket generation
  - Include estimated time indicators
  - Better feedback when processing multiple frames
  - Loading states for health metrics calculation

### 6. Validation & User Guidance
- **Missing Elements**:
  - API key format validation before requests
  - Tooltips explaining each output format
  - Guidance on optimal frame selection
  - Examples of what works best vs. what doesn't

## üì± Compatibility

### 7. Figma API Future-Proofing
- **Current State**: Using async APIs ‚úÖ, proper error handling ‚úÖ
- **Recommendations**:
  - Add Figma API version compatibility checks
  - Test with various file sizes and complexity levels
  - Monitor for Figma API deprecation notices

### 8. Output Format Compatibility
- **Testing Needed**:
  - Verify all 4 output formats in different Jira versions (Server vs Cloud)
  - Test special character escaping in various Jira configurations
  - Validate Unicode support in frame names and content
  - Test with custom Jira field configurations

## üìã Production Configuration

### 9. Configurable Options
- **Potential Enhancements**:
  - Make AI token limits user-configurable
  - Allow customization of prompt templates
  - Enable users to save favorite configurations
  - Add workspace-specific settings

### 10. Analytics & Monitoring
- **Recommended Additions**:
  - Basic usage tracking (without sensitive data)
  - Error reporting for common failure patterns
  - Success/failure metrics for ticket generation
  - Performance monitoring for large operations

## üîß Code Quality

### 11. TypeScript Improvements
- **Areas for Enhancement**:
  - Replace `any` types with more specific interfaces
  - Add stricter error type definitions
  - Include comprehensive JSDoc comments for public APIs
  - Implement proper type guards for runtime validation

### 12. Plugin Manifest & Metadata
- **Missing Information**:
  - Plugin description and author information
  - Version number that matches package.json
  - Consider additional permissions if needed for future features

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### 13. Edge Cases to Test

#### Frame & Selection Testing
- [ ] Very large frames (1000+ elements)
- [ ] Frames with no text content
- [ ] Instances with broken main components
- [ ] Files with special characters in names
- [ ] Empty selections
- [ ] Nested components and instances
- [ ] Frames with complex prototype interactions

#### API & Network Testing
- [ ] Network timeouts and failures
- [ ] OpenAI API rate limiting scenarios
- [ ] Invalid API key handling
- [ ] Malformed API responses
- [ ] Large prompt handling (near token limits)

#### Format & Output Testing
- [ ] All output formats in different Jira versions
- [ ] Special characters in generated content
- [ ] Very long ticket descriptions
- [ ] Unicode content handling
- [ ] Copy/paste functionality across platforms

### 14. Jira Integration Testing
- **Test Environments**:
  - Jira Server (various versions)
  - Jira Cloud
  - Jira Data Center
  - Custom field configurations
  - Different workflow configurations

## üìñ Documentation Requirements

### 15. User Documentation
- **Essential Guides**:
  - Quick start guide with screenshots
  - Best practices for frame selection
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Example outputs for each template type
  - FAQ section

### 16. Technical Documentation
- **Developer Resources**:
  - API integration guide
  - Custom template creation
  - Plugin architecture overview
  - Contributing guidelines
  - Deployment instructions

## üìä Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Complete security review
- [ ] Performance testing with large files
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing
- [ ] Documentation complete and reviewed
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] User feedback mechanisms in place

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor error rates and user feedback
- [ ] Track usage patterns and performance
- [ ] Plan for regular updates and maintenance
- [ ] Establish support processes
- [ ] Create feedback collection mechanisms

## üéØ Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Pre-Launch)
1. **API timeout handling** - Prevent hanging requests
2. **Comprehensive error messages** - Better user experience
3. **Frame processing limits** - Prevent memory issues
4. **User documentation** - Essential for adoption

### Medium Priority (Post-Launch)
1. **Progress indicators** - Enhanced UX
2. **Configuration options** - Power user features
3. **Analytics implementation** - Usage insights
4. **Advanced error recovery** - Improved reliability

### Low Priority (Future Versions)
1. **Custom template system** - Advanced customization
2. **Batch processing** - Enterprise features
3. **Integration APIs** - Third-party connections
4. **Advanced analytics** - Detailed insights

## üìù Notes

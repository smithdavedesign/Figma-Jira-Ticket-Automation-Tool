# Figma Desktop Testing Guide 

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 4 MCP Integration Testing - Figma Desktop

### Prerequisites âœ…
- [x] MCP Server running on localhost:3000 (4/4 tools working)
- [x] Plugin UI accessible on localhost:8080
- [x] All required files prepared

### Step 1: Install Plugin in Figma Desktop

1. **Open Figma Desktop Application**
   - Launch Figma Desktop (not browser version)
   - Sign in to your Figma account

2. **Access Plugin Developer Mode**
   - Go to `Plugins` â†’ `Development` â†’ `Import plugin from manifest`
   - Navigate to this project folder
   - Select `manifest.json` file

3. **Plugin Files to Import**
   ```
   /Users/david/Documents/Figa-Jira-Automations-Tool/figma-ticket-generator/
   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json          âœ… Main plugin configuration
   â”œâ”€â”€ code.ts                âœ… Plugin logic with MCP integration  
   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/index.html          âœ… Plugin UI with MCP client
   â””â”€â”€ ui/components/         âœ… UI components and styles
   ```

### Step 2: Test Plugin Functionality

#### 2.1 Basic Plugin Launch
- [ ] Plugin appears in Plugins menu
- [ ] Plugin window opens correctly
- [ ] UI loads without errors
- [ ] MCP server connection status shows "Connected"

#### 2.2 MCP Tool Testing via Plugin UI

**Test Case 1: analyze_project**
- [ ] Open a Figma file with multiple components
- [ ] Run "Analyze Project" from plugin
- [ ] Verify comprehensive analysis returned
- [ ] Check file key extraction works correctly

**Test Case 2: generate_tickets**  
- [ ] Select a component or frame
- [ ] Run "Generate Ticket" from plugin
- [ ] Verify structured ticket with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Test with different selection types

**Test Case 3: check_compliance**
- [ ] Run "Check Compliance" on design file
- [ ] Verify compliance report with scores
- [ ] Test different category filters
- [ ] Validate recommendations section

**Test Case 4: generate_enhanced_ticket**
- [ ] Select complex component
- [ ] Run "Generate Enhanced Ticket" 
- [ ] Verify fallback implementation
- [ ] Check React boilerplate generation

### Step 3: Real-World Scenario Testing

#### 3.1 Design System File Testing
```
Target: Large design system file (50+ components)
- Test analyze_project performance
- Validate compliance checking accuracy
- Check ticket generation for various component types
```

#### 3.2 Complex Selection Testing  
```
Test Selections:
- Single component
- Multiple components
- Nested frames
- Text layers
- Mixed selections
```

#### 3.3 Error Handling Testing
```
Error Scenarios:
- MCP server offline
- Invalid Figma URLs
- Network connectivity issues
- Large file timeouts
```

### Step 4: Performance Validation

#### 4.1 Load Testing
- [ ] Test with files containing 100+ components
- [ ] Validate response times under 5 seconds
- [ ] Check memory usage during analysis
- [ ] Verify UI responsiveness

#### 4.2 Concurrent Usage Testing
- [ ] Multiple users accessing MCP server
- [ ] Simultaneous tool executions
- [ ] Server stability under load

### Step 5: Production Readiness Checklist

#### 5.1 Core Functionality âœ…
- [x] MCP server running stable (localhost:3000)
- [x] All 4 tools working (100% success rate)
- [x] Plugin UI loading correctly
- [x] Error handling implemented

#### 5.2 Integration Testing (In Progress)
- [ ] Figma Desktop plugin installation
- [ ] Real file testing
- [ ] Performance validation
- [ ] User experience testing

#### 5.3 Documentation
- [x] Testing guide created
- [x] MCP tool documentation
- [x] Installation instructions
- [ ] User manual completion

### Expected Test Results

#### Success Criteria
1. **Plugin Installation** - Loads without errors in Figma Desktop
2. **MCP Integration** - All 4 tools accessible through plugin UI
3. **Real File Testing** - Works with actual design files
4. **Performance** - Response times under 5 seconds
5. **Stability** - No crashes or memory leaks

#### Performance Benchmarks
- **analyze_project**: < 3 seconds for files with 100+ components
- **generate_tickets**: < 2 seconds for any selection
- **check_compliance**: < 4 seconds for comprehensive analysis
- **generate_enhanced_ticket**: < 3 seconds with boilerplate

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues
1. **Plugin Won't Load**
   - Check manifest.json syntax
   - Verify all file paths are correct
   - Ensure TypeScript compiled successfully

2. **MCP Server Connection Failed**
   - Confirm server running on localhost:3000
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify network connectivity

3. **Tool Execution Errors**
   - Validate Figma URL format
   - Check required parameters
   - Review server logs for errors

#### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check MCP server status
curl http://localhost:3000/

# Test individual tools
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"method":"analyze_project","params":{"figmaUrl":"REAL_FIGMA_URL"}}'

# Monitor server logs
cd server && npm run dev
```

### Next Steps After Testing

1. **If All Tests Pass** âœ…
   - Document successful completion
   - Prepare for production deployment
   - Create user onboarding materials

2. **If Issues Found** ðŸ”§
   - Document specific failures
   - Create bug reports with reproduction steps
   - Prioritize fixes based on severity

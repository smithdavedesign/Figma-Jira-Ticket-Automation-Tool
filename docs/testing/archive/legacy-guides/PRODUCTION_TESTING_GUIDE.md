## 🔧 **Production Testing Setup**

### **Step 1: Start Production Environment**

```bash
# 1. Start MCP Server (CRITICAL)
npm run start:mvc                 # Starts app/main.js on localhost:3000

# 2. Verify MCP Server Health
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | jq '.status'  # Should return "healthy"

# 3. Build Plugin for Figma
npm run build:plugin             # Builds plugin to dist/

# 4. Validate Build
ls -la dist/                     # Verify code.js and manifest.json exist
```

### **Step 2: Load Plugin in Figma Desktop**

1. **Open Figma Desktop Application**
2. **Access Plugin Development:**
   - Menu → Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest...
   - Select: `manifest.json` from project root
3. **Verify Plugin Load:**
   - Plugin should appear in Plugins menu
   - No console errors in Figma Developer Console

### **Step 3: Initial Connection Test**

```bash
# Monitor MCP server logs in terminal
npm run monitor                  # Real-time log monitoring

# In another terminal, check health
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | jq '.'
```

## 🧪 **Production Test Scenarios**

### **Test Scenario 1: Basic Plugin Functionality**

**Objective:** Verify plugin loads and connects to MCP server

**Steps:**
1. Open any Figma file with design components
2. Run the plugin: Plugins → Figma AI Ticket Generator
3. Verify UI loads with health metrics panel and ticket generator
4. Check connection status shows "Connected" or "MCP Server Connected"

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Plugin UI loads without errors
- ✅ Health metrics panel displays default state (-- values)  
- ✅ Connection status shows server connectivity
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in browser console

### **Test Scenario 2: Frame Selection & Analysis**

**Objective:** Test frame selection and design system analysis

**Steps:**
1. Select 1-3 design components/frames in Figma
2. Click "📋 Generate Ticket from Selection"
3. Observe health metrics panel for compliance analysis
4. Wait for ticket generation completion

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Health metrics update with analysis data
- ✅ Compliance scores populate (colors, typography, components)
- ✅ Recommendations appear if applicable
- ✅ Ticket generation completes successfully

### **Test Scenario 3: AI-Enhanced Ticket Generation**

**Objective:** Test full AI-powered ticket generation workflow

**Prerequisites:** Ensure AI services are configured (optional)

**Steps:**
1. Select complex design components (buttons, forms, layouts)
2. Choose template type (UI Component, Feature, Page, etc.)
3. Select AI model (GPT-4, Gemini Pro, etc.)
4. Add custom instructions if desired
5. Generate ticket and verify output quality

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Template selection affects ticket structure
- ✅ AI model selection impacts generation approach
- ✅ Custom instructions are incorporated
- ✅ Generated ticket is professional and actionable
- ✅ Fallback generation works if AI services unavailable

### **Test Scenario 4: Error Handling & Recovery**

**Objective:** Verify graceful error handling

**Steps:**
1. Test with no selection (empty selection)
2. Test with very large selections (50+ components)
3. Test with MCP server temporarily stopped
4. Test with invalid Figma file structures

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Clear error messages for invalid states
- ✅ Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- ✅ Memory protection prevents crashes on large selections
- ✅ Recovery suggestions provided to user

### **Test Scenario 5: Performance & Resource Usage**

**Objective:** Validate performance under realistic conditions

**Steps:**
1. Test with various file sizes (small, medium, large)
2. Monitor MCP server resource usage
3. Test rapid successive generations
4. Monitor browser memory usage

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Response times under 10 seconds for typical selections
- ✅ MCP server memory stays under 50MB
- ✅ No memory leaks in browser or server
- ✅ Concurrent requests handled gracefully

## 📊 **Monitoring During Testing**

### **Real-Time Monitoring Commands**

```bash
# Terminal 1: MCP Server with logs
npm run start:mvc

# Terminal 2: Real-time monitoring
npm run monitor                  # Log monitoring
npm run monitor:health           # Health status
npm run monitor:performance      # Performance metrics

# Terminal 3: Health checks
watch -n 5 "curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | jq '.memory'"
```

### **Key Metrics to Watch**

- **Response Time:** Should be <10s for typical selections
- **Memory Usage:** MCP server should stay <50MB
- **Error Rate:** Should be <1% for valid operations
- **Connection Stability:** No connection drops during normal use

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Plugin Won't Load**
```bash
# Check build status
npm run build:plugin
ls -la dist/code.js manifest.json

# Verify manifest syntax
cat manifest.json | jq '.'
```

### **MCP Server Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check server status
lsof -i :3000
curl -s http://localhost:3000/

# Restart if needed
pkill -f "node app/main.js"
npm run start:mvc
```

### **Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check memory usage
ps aux | grep node
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | jq '.memory'

# Clear any stuck processes
pkill -f "figma-ticket-generator"
```

### **AI Services Not Working**
- Expected if API keys not configured
- Plugin should fall back to standard generation
- Verify fallback tickets still contain useful information

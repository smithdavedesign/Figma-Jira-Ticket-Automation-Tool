**Goal:** Simplify testing workflow while maintaining comprehensive coverage

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

### **Current NPM Scripts (53 total)**
- **🧪 Testing Scripts: 23** (43% - TOO MANY)
- **📊 Monitor Scripts: 5** (Consolidate to 2)  
- **🛠️ Deploy Scripts: 8** (Keep as-is)
- **⚙️ Build Scripts: 7** (Keep as-is)
- **✅ Health/Validate: 4** (Consolidate to 2)

### **Core Architecture Status**
- **✅ MVC Structure** - Well-organized with 2052-line MCP server
- **✅ Core Systems** - 25+ classes, professional logging, AI orchestration
- **✅ Template System** - 442-line TemplateManager with Redis caching
- **✅ Production Ready** - Comprehensive business logic and error handling

## 🎯 **Consolidation Strategy**

### **🚀 TIER 1: Essential Commands (Keep - 8 scripts)**
```bash
# Core Testing
npm test                       # Vitest unit tests
npm run test:suite            # Ultimate Test Suite (primary interface)
npm run test:all              # Comprehensive test runner

# System Health  
npm run health                # System health check
npm run monitor               # Live monitoring dashboard

# Development
npm run test:watch            # Development testing
npm run test:coverage         # Coverage reports
npm run validate              # Full validation
```

### **🔧 TIER 2: Specialized Commands (Combine - 6 scripts)**
```bash
# Browser Testing (combine 4 → 1)
npm run test:browser          # Combine smoke + regression + visual + ci

# Template Testing (combine 6 → 1) 
npm run test:templates        # Combine all template validation

# AI Testing (combine 4 → 1)
npm run test:ai               # Combine AI + screenshots + dashboard

# Monitoring (combine 5 → 1)
npm run monitor:all           # Combine performance + health + live

# Artifacts (combine 5 → 1)
npm run test:reports          # Combine all report viewing

# Validation (combine 3 → 1)
npm run validate:all          # Combine prod + basic validation
```

### **❌ TIER 3: Remove/Deprecate (9 scripts)**
```bash
# Remove redundant individual commands
npm run test:mcp              # Covered by test:all
npm run test:monitor          # Covered by monitor
npm run test:monitor:dashboard # Covered by monitor  
npm run test:design-system    # Covered by test:all
npm run test:performance      # Covered by test:all
npm run test:all:quick        # Covered by test:all with --quick flag
npm run test:ai:screenshots   # Covered by test:ai
npm run test:ai:dashboard     # Covered by test:ai
npm run dev:monitor           # Covered by monitor
```

## 🛠️ **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Create Master Test Scripts**
1. **Create `scripts/test-runner.js`** - Master test orchestrator
2. **Create `scripts/monitor-dashboard.js`** - Unified monitoring
3. **Create `scripts/browser-test-suite.js`** - Unified browser testing
4. **Update existing scripts** - Add consolidation logic

### **Phase 2: Update Package.json**
1. **Replace 23 test scripts** with 8 essential commands
2. **Add intelligent flags** for different test modes
3. **Maintain backwards compatibility** during transition
4. **Update help documentation** with new commands

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Test Suite Integration**
1. **Enhance Ultimate Test Suite** - Add new consolidated commands
2. **Update system health checks** - Include new monitoring
3. **Improve logging integration** - Better test result tracking
4. **Add completion dashboard** - Visual test status overview

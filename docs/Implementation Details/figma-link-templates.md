# üéØ Smart Figma Link Templates with User Guidance

## Enhanced Solution
Instead of showing "Link unavailable", the plugin now provides helpful templates and clear instructions for users to create the correct Figma links themselves.

## üîó **What Users Will See Now**

### ‚úÖ **When File Key is Available**:
```
**Figma File:** [My Design File](https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123XYZ?node-id=7013-21642)
```

### üõ†Ô∏è **When File Key is Unavailable** (NEW):
```
**Figma File:** My Design File
**Figma Link:** `https://www.figma.com/design/[YOUR_FILE_KEY]?node-id=7013-21642`
**Instructions:** Replace `[YOUR_FILE_KEY]` with your actual Figma file key from the URL.
**How to find file key:** Copy your Figma file URL - it looks like `figma.com/design/ABC123XYZ/...` where `ABC123XYZ` is your file key.
```

### üìç **Individual Frame Links**:
```
Frame 1: "Header Component"
- Direct Link: `https://www.figma.com/design/[YOUR_FILE_KEY]?node-id=7013-21642`
  (Replace `[YOUR_FILE_KEY]` with your Figma file key)

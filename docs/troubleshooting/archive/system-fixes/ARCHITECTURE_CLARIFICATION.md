# 🔧 ARCHITECTURE CLARIFICATION & FIXES

## 🎯 **The Real Architecture**

You're absolutely correct! I was confused about the architecture. Here's what we actually have:

### ✅ **Correct Architecture:**
1. **MCP Server** (running on localhost:3000) - ✅ ACTIVE
2. **Figma Plugin UI** - Should connect to MCP server via HTTP
3. **No direct Figma API** - MCP server handles Figma integration

### ❌ **What I Was Building Wrong:**
- Direct Figma API integration in plugin code
- Complex fileKey detection logic  
- Direct exportAsync() calls
- Missing MCP server connection

## 🚀 **MCP Server Status: ✅ RUNNING**

Your MCP server is running and responding:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
# Response: {"name":"Figma AI Ticket Generator","version":"1.0.0","status":"running"...}
```

**Available Tools:**
- `analyze_project`
- `generate_tickets` 
- `check_compliance`
- `generate_enhanced_ticket`

## 🛠️ **What Needs To Be Fixed**

### 1. **UI Should Connect to MCP Server**
The plugin UI should:
- Show MCP server status
- Make HTTP calls to `localhost:3000`
- Use MCP tools instead of direct Figma API

### 2. **Remove Direct Figma API Code**
- Remove fileKey detection logic
- Remove exportAsync() screenshot capture
- Remove direct figma.currentPage.selection usage

### 3. **Add MCP Server Integration**
- Add server status indicator
- Connect UI to MCP HTTP API
- Use MCP tools for all operations

## 🎯 **Correct Flow Should Be:**

```
User selects frames in Figma 
    ↓
Plugin UI gets selection context
    ↓  
UI sends HTTP request to MCP server (localhost:3000)
    ↓
MCP server processes with AI/Figma integration
    ↓
Results returned to UI
    ↓
User sees generated content
```

## 🔨 **Next Steps**

1. **Add MCP Server Status to UI**
2. **Replace Figma API calls with MCP HTTP calls**  
3. **Show server connection status**
4. **Use MCP tools for generation**
5. **Test the corrected integration**

The MCP server is running and ready - we just need to connect the UI to it properly! 🎉

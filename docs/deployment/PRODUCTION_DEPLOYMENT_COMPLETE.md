# 🎉 Production Deployment Complete - Design Intelligence Platform v4.0.0

## ✅ File Organization & Cleanup Complete

### What We Fixed:
- **Removed Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate `build.sh` in root (using `scripts/build.sh`)
- **Organized Structure**: Moved legacy TypeScript files to `src/legacy/`
- **Single Source**: Using `code-single.ts` as the authoritative source for Figma
- **Proper Build Chain**: Fixed TypeScript compilation with correct outFile configuration

### File Structure Now:
```
├── manifest.json                    # Plugin manifest for Figma
├── code.js                         # Compiled plugin code (auto-generated)
├── code-single.ts                  # Main source file (single-file for Figma)
├── ui/                             # Plugin UI interface
├── scripts/
│   ├── build.sh                    # Development build script
│   └── bundle-production.sh        # Production packaging
├── src/legacy/                     # Moved redundant files here
├── production-bundle/              # Ready-to-distribute package
└── figma-design-intelligence-platform-v4.0.0.zip  # Distribution package
```

## 🔨 Stable Node.js Server System

### Production Server Commands:
```bash
# Start stable production server
cd server && node server.js

# Or use npm scripts (if package.json cache refreshed)
npm run start:production     # Start production server
npm run stop                 # Stop server
npm run restart              # Restart server
npm run status              # Check if running

# Development build (for plugin)
./scripts/build.sh

# Production bundle (for distribution)
./scripts/bundle-production.sh
```

### Live Debugging & Monitoring:
```bash
# View live server logs with session tracking
cd server && node server.js
# Real-time logs show: requests, AI processing, session tracking

# Debug endpoints for monitoring
curl http://localhost:3000/debug/health      # Server health & stats
curl http://localhost:3000/debug/sessions    # Session tracking data
curl http://localhost:3000                   # Full server status
```

### Server Features:
- **Stable Node.js**: Replaced unreliable TypeScript/tsx with production-ready Node.js
- **Live Session Tracking**: Real-time user journey monitoring from Figma → AI → Output
- **Request Correlation**: Each request gets unique session ID for end-to-end debugging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response times, AI processing duration, error tracking
- **Debug Endpoints**: `/debug/health` and `/debug/sessions` for live monitoring
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging with fallback responses

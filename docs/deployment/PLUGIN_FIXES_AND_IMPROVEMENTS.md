# Figma Plugin Fixes & Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes and improvements made to the Figma Plugin during the screenshot capture integration phase.

## Major Fixes Implemented

### 1. File Key Detection System
**Problem**: `figma.fileKey` was returning `undefined` in certain Figma environments, breaking screenshot capture.

**Solution**: Implemented dynamic file key extraction system:
- Added UI-based file key extraction from browser URL
- Implemented fallback to known file key (`BioUSVD6t51ZNeG0g9AcNz`)
- Added bidirectional communication between plugin and UI for real-time file key detection

**Files Modified**:
- `code.js`: Added `continueScreenshotWithFileKey()` function
- `ui/index.html`: Added message handlers for file key requests
- Enhanced all screenshot functions with robust file key detection

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Compliance
**Problem**: Screenshots from AWS S3 CDN were blocked by Figma's CSP policies.

**Solution**: Updated manifest.json to include AWS S3 domains:
```json
"allowedDomains": [
  "https://www.figma.com",
  "https://figma-alpha-api.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
  "https://*.amazonaws.com"
]
```

**Impact**: Enables screenshot images to load properly in the plugin UI.

### 3. Design Token Extraction Error Handling
**Problem**: Design token extraction was causing TypeError crashes when accessing undefined properties.

**Solution**: Wrapped `extractDesignTokens()` function in comprehensive try-catch blocks:
- Added null checks for all property accesses
- Implemented graceful fallbacks for missing properties  
- Added error logging without breaking plugin functionality

### 4. Enhanced Screenshot Capture Logic
**Improvements**:
- Smart node selection for optimal screenshot framing
- Multi-selection handling with common parent detection
- Fallback to placeholder images when API unavailable
- Comprehensive error reporting and debugging

### 5. Advanced Context Enhancement
**Features Added**:
- Real-time design token extraction
- Component variant detection
- Semantic role determination
- Enhanced hierarchy analysis
- Color palette extraction with hex conversion

### 6. Plugin-UI Communication System
**Enhancements**:
- Bidirectional message passing for file key detection
- Real-time context updates
- Enhanced error reporting to UI
- Debug information display

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Key Extraction Flow
1. Check `figma.fileKey` directly
2. If undefined/invalid, request from UI via browser URL
3. Parse URL to extract file key from Figma's routing
4. Use extracted key for API calls
5. Fall back to known good key if all else fails

### Screenshot API Integration
- Backend API endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/figma/screenshot`
- Supports single and multiple node capture
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Returns high-quality PNG images with metadata

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when API unavailable
- Placeholder generation for failed screenshots
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages in UI

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Efficient Node Traversal  
- Optimized hierarchy building algorithm
- Smart parent detection for multi-selections
- Cached component property access

### 2. Network Request Optimization
- Request deduplication
- Proper timeout handling
- Retry logic with backoff
- Parallel processing where possible

### 3. Memory Management
- Efficient base64 encoding
- Cleanup of temporary data
- Optimized string operations

## Testing & Validation

### Scenarios Tested
✅ Single node screenshot capture  
✅ Multiple node screenshot capture  
✅ Component instance handling  
✅ File key extraction in various environments  
✅ CSP compliance for image loading  
✅ Error handling and fallbacks  
✅ Design token extraction  
✅ Real-time context updates  

### Browser Compatibility
✅ Chrome (Figma Desktop & Web)  
✅ Firefox (Figma Web)  
✅ Safari (Figma Web)  
✅ Edge (Figma Web)  

## Build & Deployment

### Build Process
```bash
# Clean previous build
npm run clean

# Compile TypeScript
npx tsc

# Build plugin
npm run build
```

### Plugin Installation
1. Copy compiled files to Figma plugins directory
2. Import manifest.json in Figma
3. Verify permissions and domains
4. Test in development environment

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Debug Features Added
- Enhanced console logging with prefixes
- Real-time context debugging
- API request/response logging
- Error tracking with stack traces
- Performance timing measurements

### Debug Commands
- `debug-selection`: Capture full selection context
- `get-context`: Get current file and selection info
- `precise-screenshot`: Detailed screenshot capture

## Security Considerations

### CSP Compliance
- All external domains properly declared
- No inline scripts or unsafe evaluations
- Secure image loading from approved CDNs

### Data Privacy
- No sensitive data logged to console
- File keys handled securely
- User selections processed locally

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. Caching layer for repeated API calls
2. Offline mode with local fallbacks
3. Advanced component property extraction
4. Enhanced semantic analysis
5. Performance metrics dashboard

### Technical Debt
- Consolidate error handling patterns
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Optimize bundle size

## Dependencies & Requirements

### Runtime Dependencies
- Figma Plugin API (latest)
- Modern browser with ES6+ support
- Backend server running on port 3000

### Development Dependencies
- TypeScript 4.5+
- Node.js 16+
- npm/yarn for package management

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
FIGMA_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
SCREENSHOT_TIMEOUT=15000
MAX_RETRIES=3
DEFAULT_FILE_KEY=BioUSVD6t51ZNeG0g9AcNz
```

### Plugin Settings
```json
{
  "development": {
    "apiEndpoint": "http://localhost:3000",
    "debug": true
  },
  "production": {
    "apiEndpoint": "https://api.yourdomain.com",
    "debug": false
  }
}
```

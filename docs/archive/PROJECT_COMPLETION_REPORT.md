- **Cache Performance:** ✅ Verified cache hits and consistent responses

### 3. 🌐 SERVER FUNCTIONALITY ✅
- **Health Endpoint:** ✅ Comprehensive system status with Redis metrics
- **JIRA Ticket Generation:** ✅ Working with caching
- **GitHub Ticket Generation:** ✅ Working with caching  
- **Confluence Ticket Generation:** ✅ Working with caching
- **Error Handling:** ✅ Improved with detailed logging
- **ES Module Compatibility:** ✅ Fixed import issues

### 4. 📋 TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE ✅
- **Redis Test Suite:** Organized in `tests/redis/` with comprehensive coverage
- **Integration Tests:** ✅ Figma context integration working
- **Caching Tests:** ✅ Cache hits, misses, and consistency verified
- **End-to-End Validation:** ✅ 15/18 tests passing in final validation

## 🚀 PRODUCTION READINESS

### REDIS CACHING SYSTEM
```
✅ Connection: localhost:6379 (healthy)
✅ Latency: ~1ms response time
✅ Features: JSON serialization, TTL, graceful fallback
✅ Performance: Cache hits working, consistent responses
✅ Monitoring: Health checks and detailed logging
```

### SERVER ARCHITECTURE
```
✅ MVC Pattern: Clean separation of concerns
✅ Node.js: v22.14.0 with ES modules
✅ Express-style: HTTP server on port 3000
✅ Redis Integration: Persistent storage enabled
✅ Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and recovery
```

## Strategic Vision

This project serves as the **strategic layer above Figma's tactical MCP server**, focusing on:
- Project-level intelligence vs individual frame processing
- Business workflow integration vs developer-only tools  
- Strategic planning capabilities vs pure code generation
- Complete product team value vs single stakeholder focus

**Our positioning**: "Figma MCP generates code. We generate strategy, tickets, and project plans."

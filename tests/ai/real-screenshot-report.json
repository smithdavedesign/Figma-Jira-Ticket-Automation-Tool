      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement Material Design Button Component\n\nThis ticket covers the implementation of a Material Design Button component for AEM, adhering to the provided visual design and Material Design principles. The button component provides a consistent and accessible user interface element for triggering actions within the AEM environment. This will improve user experience by providing a familiar and predictable interaction pattern across the platform.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy:*\n- Create a new AEM component using the HTL templating language and Sling Models for backend logic.\n- Leverage the Core Components' styling system for consistency and maintainability.\n- Employ a modular CSS architecture (e.g., BEM) for styling the button.\n- Use AEM's dialog functionality to allow content authors to configure the button's text, link, style, and other attributes.\n- Implement a dispatcher flush rule for any button changes.\n\n*Component Architecture:*\n- *HTL Template:* Handles the rendering of the button's HTML structure, including the button text and link.\n- *Sling Model:* Provides the data to the HTL template, including button text, link URL, target, and style variations.  This will handle reading properties from the JCR.\n- *Client Libraries:* Contains the CSS and JavaScript (if necessary) for styling and handling button interactions (hover, focus, click).\n\n*Data Flow:*\n- Content authors configure the button's properties in the AEM dialog.\n- The Sling Model reads these properties from the JCR.\n- The HTL template uses the data from the Sling Model to render the button.\n- Client libraries apply the styling and handle any interactive behavior.\n\n*Design System Integration:*\n- The button component should adhere to the existing design system by using consistent color palettes, typography, and spacing.\n- Leverage AEM's Style System to provide authors with predefined styles for the button, allowing for variations while maintaining design consistency.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations:*\n- Optimize CSS and JavaScript for minimal impact on page load time.\n- Ensure the button meets WCAG accessibility guidelines:\n  - Proper ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility (e.g., `aria-label` if needed).\n  - Sufficient color contrast between the button text and background.\n  - Keyboard navigation support (focus state styling).\n  - Use semantic HTML `<button>` element instead of `<a>` or `<div>` if the button doesn't navigate to a new page.  If it *does* navigate, use `<a>` with proper `href` and styling to appear as a button.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values:*\n- Background Color (Normal): #1a75d1\n- Text Color: #ffffff\n\n*Typography:*\n- Font Family: Roboto\n- Font Size: 14px\n- Font Weight: Regular (400)\n\n*Spacing:*\n- Padding (Horizontal): Consider using 16px or 24px padding left and right.\n- Padding (Vertical):  Consider using 8px padding top and bottom.\n- Spacing should be derived from the 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px pattern.\n\n*Interactive States:*\n- *Hover State:* Slightly darken the background color (#1763b2 is one option) and add a subtle box-shadow.\n- *Focus State:* Add an outline around the button to indicate focus for keyboard users.\n- *Active/Pressed State:* Slightly darken the background color more and reduce the box-shadow.\n\n*Responsive Behavior:*\n- The button width should adapt to its content.\n- Consider breakpoints for smaller screens if the button text is too long and might cause overflow.\n- If needed, stack the button text vertically on smaller screens.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n*Functional:*\n- [ ] The button component should render correctly with the specified text and link URL.\n- [ ] Clicking the button should navigate to the specified URL (if applicable).\n- [ ] The button should have the correct hover, focus, and active states.\n- [ ]  Button click should be tracked via configured analytics.\n- [ ] The component dialog should allow content authors to configure the button's text, link URL, target, and style.\n- [ ] If the button is a link, the `target` attribute should be configurable (e.g., `_blank` to open in a new tab).\n\n*Visual:*\n- [ ] The button's background color and text color should match the specified values.\n- [ ] The button's font should be Roboto, with a size of 14px.\n- [ ] The button should have the correct padding and spacing.\n- [ ] The interactive states (hover, focus, active) should match the specified design.\n- [ ] The button should be visually consistent across different browsers and devices.\n\n*Accessibility:*\n- [ ] The button should be keyboard accessible.\n- [ ] The button should have sufficient color contrast between the text and background.\n- [ ]  If the button text is not descriptive enough, `aria-label` should be used to provide a more detailed description for screen reader users.\n- [ ] The button must have a discernible focus state.\n\n*Performance:*\n- [ ] The button component should not significantly impact page load time.\n- [ ] CSS and JavaScript should be optimized for performance.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization:*\n- Create a separate folder for the button component within the AEM project's `ui.content` module.\n- Use a consistent naming convention for files and folders (e.g., `material-button`, `material-button.html`, `material-button.css`, `MaterialButton.java`).\n- Organize CSS using BEM naming conventions to ensure maintainability and avoid naming conflicts.\n\n*Testing Strategy:*\n- Unit tests for the Sling Model to verify that it correctly retrieves data from the JCR.\n- Integration tests to verify that the component renders correctly in AEM.\n- Automated UI tests (e.g., Selenium) to verify the button's functionality and visual appearance.\n- Accessibility testing to ensure the button meets WCAG guidelines.\n\n*Potential Gotchas:*\n- Ensure that the CSS is properly namespaced to avoid conflicts with other components on the page.\n- Be mindful of the impact of JavaScript on page load time. Minimize the amount of JavaScript required for the button component.\n- Thoroughly test the button component across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.\n- Be aware of potential security vulnerabilities when handling user-provided URLs and implement appropriate sanitization.\n- Consider internationalization (i18n) requirements for the button text and ensure the component can handle different languages.\n- Ensure dispatcher rules are appropriately configured to flush the cache when the button component is updated.  In AEMaaCS, this requires proper configuration of the Cloud Manager pipeline.\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement the Bootstrap Icon Card Component\n\nThis ticket describes the implementation of a visual icon card component, visually similar to the Bootstrap icon or logo, used to represent branding or to provide visual appeal as a placeholder. The immediate business value is improved aesthetics and brand recognition. This component will initially be used as a placeholder; in the future it might be an interactive button or link.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy*: We will implement a `BootstrapIconCard` component in React TypeScript using SVG and styled-components (or CSS modules).\n\n*Component Architecture*:\nThe component will be a functional component accepting a size and potentially a color prop. It will render a stylized 'B' within a card-shaped SVG.\n\n*Data Flow*:  Props will be passed down to customize the size and potentially the color.\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System*:\nThe colors should be taken from our existing color palette if available.  We need to ensure the SVG rendering aligns with the existing icon library/system and avoids duplication.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations*:\nBecause the card will be rendered as an SVG, make sure it is properly optimized to reduce its size. It does not need alt text for now since it's decorative.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values*:  The component is filled with a violet color (approx. `#800080`). The 'B' is rendered with white.\n\n*Typography Specs*:  The 'B' is sans-serif.\n\n*Spacing Measurements*: No specific padding is required for the initial implementation as the B spans the shape.\n\n*Responsive Behavior*: The size of the `BootstrapIconCard` can be customized with the `size` prop and will scale accordingly to different screen sizes. This is handled using relative units (e.g., `em`, `rem`, `%`) in the SVG.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n*Functional Requirements*:\n*   The component renders a 'B' inside a visually distinctive shape, consistent with the design (rounded edges).\n*   The `size` prop correctly scales the icon, adjusting the width and height of the SVG.\n*   The `color` prop correctly changes the color of the shape (if we choose to implement this prop).\n\n*Visual Accuracy Requirements*:\n*   The color should match design specifications (violet shape and white \"B\").\n*   The shape of the card should match the design closely.\n*   The 'B' is centered within the shape.\n\n*Performance Benchmarks*:\n*   The SVG is optimized and does not introduce significant performance overhead.\n*   The component renders quickly without blocking the main thread.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization and File Structure*:\nCreate a directory `src/components/BootstrapIconCard`.\nCreate files: `BootstrapIconCard.tsx` (main component), `BootstrapIconCard.module.css` or `BootstrapIconCard.styled.ts` (styling).\n\n*Testing Strategy*:\nCreate a component test to verify the rendering of the B inside the shape is correct.\nUse screenshot testing to ensure visual accuracy and that the icon is rendered with correct size and color.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges*:\n*   SVG optimization to minimize file size and rendering time.\n*   Consistency of the visual shape across different browsers and screen resolutions.\n*   Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies.\n*   Make sure to account for proper contrast ratio for accessibility if it is going to be an interactive button.\n*   Consider using a well tested 3rd party library for the styling (styled components, emotion or similar) so we avoid the need to reinvent the wheel.\n*   Consider the `fill` of the svg if it is a single svg element or an array of `path`.\n",

      "aiResponse": "Here's a professional Asana ticket in Jira markup format based on the provided analysis.\n\nh1. 🎯 Executive Summary\n\nThis ticket defines the implementation of a Chakra UI Modal component in Angular. The modal will provide a focused overlay for critical user interactions, ensuring a clear and intuitive experience.  This enhances usability by preventing distractions and guiding users through specific workflows or confirmations.  By leveraging Chakra UI, we maintain design consistency and accelerate development.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Angular Implementation Strategy:*\n\nWe will create an Angular component (`ChakraModalComponent`) that wraps the Chakra UI `<Modal>` component. This approach provides type safety and allows us to manage the modal's state and behavior within the Angular framework.  We'll leverage Angular's change detection for efficient updates and use RxJS for handling asynchronous operations if needed (e.g., closing the modal after a successful API call).\n\n*Component Architecture & Data Flow:*\n\nThe `ChakraModalComponent` will receive its content, title, and button actions as *inputs*.  An *output* event will notify the parent component when the modal is closed (either by clicking a close button or using the escape key). The structure would look something like this:\n\n```typescript\n{{\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-chakra-modal',\n  templateUrl: './chakra-modal.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./chakra-modal.component.scss']\n})\nexport class ChakraModalComponent {\n  @Input() isOpen: boolean = false;\n  @Input() title: string = '';\n  @Input() content: string = '';\n  @Output() closeModal = new EventEmitter<void>();\n\n  onClose(): void {\n    this.closeModal.emit();\n  }\n}\n}}\n```\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System:*\n\nChakra UI already provides a consistent design language.  We'll ensure that our implementation adheres to our existing color palette, typography, and spacing guidelines.  We'll create custom Chakra UI themes if necessary to align with our specific brand requirements.  Specifically, we will ensure the default Chakra Theme object is extended with our specified color palette.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations:*\n\nThe modal should be lazy-loaded to avoid impacting initial page load time.  We'll ensure proper focus management (using `autoFocus` and `finalFocusRef` properties in Chakra UI Modal) for keyboard navigation. ARIA attributes (`aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) will be used to provide semantic information for screen readers. We'll specifically implement a trap focus feature to ensure that the focus does not escape the bounds of the modal when using the `tab` key.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values:*\n* Component Fill 1: #309694\n* Component Fill 2: #ffffff\n\n*Typography:*\n* Font Family: Inter\n* Font Size: 16px (base size - adjust for header/body text)\n* Hierarchy: Use appropriate Chakra UI heading components (`Heading`, `Text`) to maintain hierarchy and styling.\n\n*Spacing:*\n* Utilize Chakra UI's spacing scale (e.g., `mx={4}`, `my={8}`) to maintain consistent spacing.  Refer to the identified spacing patterns (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px).\n\n*Responsive Behavior:*\n\nThe modal should be centered on the screen and adapt to different screen sizes.  We can use Chakra UI's `useBreakpointValue` hook to adjust the modal's size and positioning based on the current breakpoint.  Consider using a full-screen modal on smaller devices for optimal usability.\n\n*Interactive States:*\n\nEnsure hover/focus states are visually clear on buttons and interactive elements within the modal. Use Chakra UI's `_hover` and `_focus` pseudo-selectors.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n*Functional Requirements:*\n* The modal should open and close correctly based on the `isOpen` input.\n* The `closeModal` output should emit when the modal is closed.\n* Focus should be trapped within the modal while it is open.\n* Escape key should close the modal.\n* Clicking outside the modal content should close the modal.\n\n*Visual Accuracy Requirements:*\n* The modal should match the provided design in terms of colors, typography, and spacing.\n* The modal should be centered on the screen.\n* Hover/focus states should be visually distinct.\n* The layout should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.\n\n*Performance Benchmarks:*\n* The modal should open and close smoothly without noticeable lag.\n* The initial page load time should not be significantly impacted by the modal component (lazy loading).\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization and File Structure:*\n\nCreate a dedicated folder for the modal component (`src/app/components/chakra-modal`). Include the following files:\n* `chakra-modal.component.ts` (component logic)\n* `chakra-modal.component.html` (component template)\n* `chakra-modal.component.scss` (component styles)\n* `chakra-modal.component.spec.ts` (unit tests)\n\n*Testing Strategy:*\n* Write unit tests to verify the component's logic (e.g., opening/closing, emitting events).\n* Use component integration tests to verify the component's rendering and interaction with Chakra UI.\n* Conduct end-to-end tests to ensure the modal works correctly within the application.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges:*\n* Managing focus within the modal can be tricky. Use `autoFocus` and `finalFocusRef` carefully.\n* Ensure proper ARIA attributes are set for accessibility.\n* Consider using a utility function to handle modal state management if multiple modals are used throughout the application.\n* Watch out for z-index conflicts with other components on the page.\n",

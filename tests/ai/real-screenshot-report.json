The component should adhere to the provided visual design and integrate seamlessly with the existing design system. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and responsiveness are critical requirements.\n\n**ðŸŽ¯ Visual Analysis Summary:**\n\nThe design features a stylized \"B\" icon in the center. The card has a rounded shape with a distinctive bracket-like border. It looks like a modern Bootstrap-inspired logo with an abstract look. The card has two colors: a purple fill and a white \"B\".\n\n**ðŸ“‹ Implementation Details:**\n\n*   **Component Name:** `BootstrapCard`\n*   **Technology:** React TypeScript\n*   **File Structure:**\n    *   `src/components/BootstrapCard/BootstrapCard.tsx`\n    *   `src/components/BootstrapCard/BootstrapCard.module.css` (or `styled-components`)\n    *   `src/components/BootstrapCard/BootstrapCard.test.tsx`\n*   **Core Functionality:**\n    *   The component will render the visual card, ensuring correct visual fidelity to the provided screenshot.\n    *   The \"B\" icon should be configurable. This could be achieved by making it a React `children` or by providing a prop for the text.\n    *   The purple color can be made configurable by passing color props.\n    *   The card outline needs to be generated either by SVG or through CSS tricks.\n\n**ðŸŽ¨ Design System Integration:**\n\n*   **Color Palette:**\n    *   Purple fill: Utilize a color variable from the design system representing the same color found in the image.  If no such variable exists, create one, eg. `$brand-primary`.\n    *   White text: Use a color variable from the design system, `$white`, as the B icon color.\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Font: `system-ui` should be applied globally (check the root of the design system).\n    *   Size:  The size of the letter should be set using existing design system tokens or create a new appropriate token. The size should also have responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes.\n*   **Spacing:**\n    *   The margins of the Card will adhere to 8px or 16px as detected spacing.\n\n**âœ… Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   **Visual Fidelity:** The rendered component should match the design screenshot precisely in all browsers and devices.\n*   **Design System Compliance:** All colors, typography, and spacing must be derived from the design system.\n*   **Accessibility:**\n    *   The component should be focusable.\n    *   Use appropriate ARIA attributes.\n    *   Pass accessibility audits with no critical or serious violations.  Use tools like axe DevTools.\n*   **Responsiveness:** The component should scale appropriately on different screen sizes using media queries or responsive utilities provided by the CSS framework.\n*   **Reusability:** The component should be easily reusable throughout the application with different content and configurations (e.g., different sizes).\n*   **Unit Tests:**  Write comprehensive unit tests covering all aspects of the component's functionality and rendering.\n*   **Code Quality:**  The code should be clean, well-documented, and follow best practices for React and TypeScript.\n\n**ðŸ”§ Technical Notes:**\n\n*   **Styling Approach:** Explore using CSS modules or styled-components for styling.  Ensure the chosen approach aligns with existing project conventions.\n*   **SVG vs. CSS:** Consider using SVG for the card border if it's too complex to create with CSS. If using CSS, explore `border-radius` and pseudo-elements.\n*   **Performance:** Be mindful of rendering performance, especially when dealing with complex styling.  Utilize React.memo or other optimization techniques as needed.\n*   **TypeScript:** Ensure all components and props are properly typed with TypeScript.\n*   **Accessibility:** Test with a screen reader to ensure proper screen reader support.\n\n**ðŸ“± Responsive Considerations:**\n\n*   **Scaling:** The card and its contents should scale proportionally on smaller screens.\n*   **Breakpoints:** Define appropriate breakpoints to adjust the layout and typography for different screen sizes.\n*   **Testing:** Test the component on a variety of devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.  Use browser developer tools to simulate different devices.\n\n**Attachments:**\n\n*   [Link to Figma file](Bootstrap Card - React TypeScript Real Screenshot Test)\n*   Screenshot of the component\n\n**Story Points:** 5\n",

      "aiResponse": "Okay, I've reviewed the provided screenshot (which is just a solid blue color, implying a placeholder), the Figma selection details, and the enhanced design context.  I will generate a comprehensive Asana ticket for the Angular implementation of the Chakra UI Modal, based on the *assumption* that the screenshot represents a basic modal structure, even though there's no visible modal content. I will treat the blue screen as the modal's backdrop.\n\n**Asana Ticket: Implement Chakra UI Modal Component (Angular)**\n\n**Project:** Component Library\n\n**Section:** Development\n\n**Assignee:** (Developer Name)\n\n**Due Date:** (Date)\n\n**1. ðŸŽ¯ Visual Analysis Summary:**\n\n*   **Overall:** This ticket is for the implementation of a Chakra UI-based modal component in Angular. The modal consists of a backdrop (currently represented by a solid blue screen placeholder in the screenshot).\n*   **Backdrop:** The backdrop overlays the existing page content, dimming it to focus attention on the modal. The backdrop's color is #309694 (Component fill 1).  It likely covers the entire viewport. It blocks interaction with the underlying content. Clicking the backdrop (or a close button within the modal) should close the modal.\n*   **Modal Content (Placeholder):** The screenshot displays a full blue color, implying it needs to be populated.\n*   **Behavior:** When activated, the modal should appear centered on the screen (horizontally and vertically), or positioned as needed by the containing application.\n\n**2. ðŸ“‹ Implementation Details:**\n\n*   **Component Name:** `ChakraModalComponent`\n*   **Framework:** Angular\n*   **Chakra UI:** Leverage Chakra UI for the styling and structure of the modal.\n*   **Backdrop:**  Implement the backdrop as an overlay element with the specified color (#309694). Ensure the backdrop covers the entire screen and prevents interaction with elements underneath.\n*   **Modal Structure:** Use Chakra UI's `Modal` component as a base.  Set up basic structure that accepts `ng-content` to display variable modal content\n*   **Service/Store integration (if needed):** If the modal needs to share state with the rest of the application (e.g., modal state controlled by a service), use a service or NgRx store for data flow.  Design it as a pure, presentational component that receives inputs and emits outputs.\n*   **Accessibility:** Implement proper ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) to make the modal accessible to screen readers.  Use `FocusTrap` to ensure the focus stays within the modal. Implement keyboard navigation for dismissing modal.\n*   **Event Handling:** Clicking the backdrop should trigger a close event.\n*   **Animation (Optional):** Consider adding a subtle fade-in/fade-out animation for the modal appearance/disappearance to enhance user experience.\n\n**3. ðŸŽ¨ Design System Integration:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Use `#309694` as the backdrop color (Component fill 1). Name this variable something consistent with design system conventions, e.g., `$chakra-modal-backdrop`.\n    *   Use `#ffffff` for any background content behind/within the modal content area.\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use the `Inter` font family as defined in the typography system.\n    *   The modal content (titles, text, buttons) will follow the `Primary`, `Secondary`, and `Caption` hierarchy guidelines.\n*   **Spacing & Layout:**\n    *   Adhere to the 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, and 32px spacing pattern throughout the modal's content.\n    *   Utilize flexbox or grid for responsive and flexible layout within the modal.\n*   **Component Architecture:**  Re-use the `ChakraModalComponent` for similar use cases across the application.\n\n**4. âœ… Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n*   The modal backdrop is displayed correctly with the designated color (#309694).\n*   The modal backdrop prevents interaction with the content behind it.\n*   The modal's content is correctly positioned and styled based on the design system.\n*   The modal can be closed by clicking the backdrop.\n*   The modal is accessible to screen readers (ARIA attributes are correctly implemented).\n*   Focus is trapped within the modal when it's open.\n*   The modal is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.\n*   The modal uses the correct font (Inter) and typography styles as defined in the design system.\n*   Adheres to spacing pattern (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px).\n*   Code follows Angular best practices and is well-documented.\n\n**5. ðŸ”§ Technical Notes:**\n\n*   Consider using Angular CDK's `Overlay` module for creating the modal backdrop. This provides a robust and flexible way to manage overlays.\n*   Implement `OnPush` change detection strategy for optimal performance.\n*   Separate the modal's presentation logic from its data loading and processing logic.  Use input properties to pass data into the component, and output events to signal changes.\n*   Implement a `ModalService` to control the opening and closing of the modal, if needed by application requirements.\n*   Use a CSS variable for the backdrop color so it is customizable and themeable.\n*   Ensure the backdrop is fully transparent and covers the whole page before transitioning to the defined backdrop color.\n\n**6. ðŸ“± Responsive Considerations:**\n\n*   The modal should be centered on the screen on all devices (or positioned as required per a specific application use).\n*   Modal's width should adapt responsively. Consider using `max-width` to ensure the modal content doesn't become excessively wide on larger screens. Use appropriate Chakra UI responsive breakpoints for these.\n*   Text and element sizes should scale appropriately on smaller screens.\n*   Test the modal on various devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience.\n*   Use media queries or Chakra UI's responsive styles to adjust the modal's layout based on screen size.\n\n**Subtasks:**\n\n*   [ ] Create `ChakraModalComponent` with backdrop and content placeholder.\n*   [ ] Implement backdrop styling (color, transparency, click-to-close).\n*   [ ] Integrate with Chakra UI's `Modal` component for basic structure.\n*   [ ] Implement focus trapping using `FocusTrap`.\n*   [ ] Add ARIA attributes for accessibility.\n*   [ ] Implement responsive styles.\n*   [ ] Write unit tests for the component.\n*   [ ] Document the component's usage and API.\n\n**Attachments:**\n\n*   Figma File: Chakra UI Modal - Angular Real Screenshot Test\n*   Screenshot: Chakra UI Modal\n\nThis ticket provides a comprehensive outline for the implementation of a Chakra UI modal component in Angular.  It covers the visual design, technical details, accessibility considerations, and testing requirements. Remember to replace placeholder values (e.g., Assignee, Due Date) with actual values and update the ticket with any specific requirements of the application using the modal.  The key is to remember that the screenshot was largely just a placeholder and the real work is building the right modal *structure* for displaying future content.\n",

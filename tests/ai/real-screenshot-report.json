The button component provides a standard interactive element for users to trigger actions on the page, enhancing user engagement and facilitating navigation. This component is crucial for maintaining visual consistency and a cohesive user experience across the AEM site. Its primary purpose is to act as a clickable element, transitioning between different states upon user interaction, such as hover, focus, and active.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*AEM Implementation Strategy:*\nThe Material Design Button will be implemented as a custom AEM component using HTL (Sightly) for the markup, Sling Models for data retrieval and logic, and client libraries (CSS and JavaScript) for styling and interactive behavior.\n\n*Component Architecture and Data Flow:*\nThe component will be structured as follows:\n*Sling Model (Java):*  Handles retrieving properties (e.g., button label, link URL, target attribute, variant styling) from the AEM dialog.\n*HTL Template:* Generates the HTML markup for the button, leveraging the Sling Model to populate dynamic content.\n*Client Libraries (CSS/JS):*  Provides the visual styling and interactive behavior (e.g., hover effects, click handling, focus states).  CSS will use the provided color system and spacing specifications.\n*Dialog (cq:dialog):*  Defines the editable properties for the button component within the AEM authoring environment.\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System:*\nThe button will be integrated with the existing design system by adhering to the established color palette, typography, and spacing guidelines. Consider utilizing AEM Style System to provide authors with pre-defined style variations for the button, promoting consistency and reusability.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations:*\n*Lazy Loading:* N/A - Buttons typically do not require lazy loading.\n*Accessibility:*  Ensure the button is accessible by providing appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label` if the button text is not descriptive), ensuring proper keyboard navigation (focus states), and maintaining sufficient color contrast.\n*Performance:* Optimize CSS and JavaScript to minimize impact on page load time. Defer loading of non-critical JavaScript if necessary.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values:*\n* Primary Color (Normal): #1a75d1\n* Text Color (Normal): #ffffff\n\n*Typography:*\n* Font: Roboto\n* Size: 14px\n\n*Spacing:*\nThe component should adhere to the specified spacing patterns of 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, and 48px for internal padding and margins. The screenshot shows the button having a filled background with text overlaid, padding should be applied to the text to ensure optimal visual spacing.  I recommend 16px left and right padding, and 8px top and bottom.\n\n*Interactive States:*\n* *Hover State:* (Implement a hover effect using CSS) Slightly lighten the background color or add a subtle shadow.\n* *Focus State:* (Implement a focus indicator using CSS) Add an outline around the button to indicate focus when navigating with the keyboard. Ensure this is visually distinct and meets accessibility standards.\n* *Active (Pressed) State:* (Implement an active state using CSS) Slightly darken the background color.\n\n*Responsive Behavior:*\nThe button should adapt to different screen sizes. Consider using CSS media queries to adjust the button's size, padding, and font size as needed for smaller screens.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n*Functional Requirements:*\n* The button, when clicked, navigates to the specified URL.\n* The button's text matches the text entered in the AEM dialog.\n* The button's target attribute is correctly set based on the AEM dialog (e.g., _blank for opening in a new tab).\n* The button renders with the correct color and typography as specified in the design.\n* The button's hover, focus, and active states are visually distinct and meet accessibility standards.\n\n*Visual Accuracy:*\n* The button's dimensions (width, height, padding) match the design specifications within a reasonable tolerance (e.g., +/- 2px).\n* The button's font family, font size, and font weight match the design specifications.\n* The button renders with the correct background color and text color.\n\n*Performance Benchmarks:*\n* The button's CSS and JavaScript do not significantly impact page load time (e.g., should load within X milliseconds).\n* The button's interactive states (hover, focus, active) are responsive and do not introduce noticeable lag.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization and File Structure:*\nOrganize the component's code within the appropriate AEM project structure (e.g., `/apps/<project>/components/content/materialdesignbutton`). Follow established AEM best practices for code organization and naming conventions. Create a separate client library for the button's CSS and JavaScript.\n\n*Testing Strategy:*\n*Unit Testing:*  Write unit tests for the Sling Model to verify that it correctly retrieves and formats data.\n*Functional Testing:*  Test the button's functionality (e.g., navigation, target attribute) using automated testing tools or manual testing.\n*Visual Regression Testing:* Use visual regression testing tools to ensure that the button's appearance remains consistent across different browsers and devices.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges:*\n*CSS Specificity:* Be mindful of CSS specificity when styling the button to avoid conflicts with existing styles. Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) or a similar naming convention to manage CSS specificity.\n*Accessibility:* Thoroughly test the button's accessibility to ensure that it meets WCAG guidelines. Use accessibility testing tools and manual testing to identify and fix any issues.\n*Sling Model Injection:* Ensure proper injection of dependencies in the Sling Model for efficient data retrieval.\n```",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement Bootstrap Card Icon Component\n\nThis ticket details the implementation of a React TypeScript component that renders the Bootstrap Card icon (a stylized \"B\" within a shape resembling a card). This component will enhance the visual consistency and branding across the application.  The main value is brand representation and recognition. The user will see the Bootstrap brand represented which could increase trust, or provide information about which technologies power this website.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy*:\n\n*   We will create a new React TypeScript component, `BootstrapCardIcon.tsx`, within the existing design system's component library (assuming one exists).\n*   The component will use inline SVG markup to render the icon, giving us fine-grained control over the shape and styling.\n*   The component will accept `size` and `color` props to control the icon's dimensions and fill color, allowing for flexible usage across different contexts.\n*   A `className` prop will be included for adding custom CSS classes, allowing for integration with existing styling solutions.\n\n*Component Architecture & Data Flow*:\n\n*   The component will be a functional component, receiving props via the function's arguments.\n*   The data flow is simple: the component receives props (size, color, className) and renders the SVG based on these props.\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System*:\n\n*   The component should be added to the design system's component library and documented.\n*   The component should adhere to the existing design system's coding standards and naming conventions.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations*:\n\n*   The inline SVG approach minimizes external dependencies and network requests, promoting good performance.\n*   An `aria-label` prop will be added to provide a text alternative for screen readers, improving accessibility.  If the card links to the Bootstrap documentation, the aria-label should reflect that.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values*:\n\n*   Primary Fill Color: The purple color appears to be a gradient, but for initial implementation, we can extract a representative hex value. A good starting point is approximating the primary fill color as `#7952B3` or `#635BFF`, though a gradient will need to be researched.\n*   Background Color: Transparent (the icon should adapt to the background color of its parent element).\n*   Letter Color: White (`#FFFFFF`).\n\n*Typography Specs*:\n\n*   Font: This is an icon, not text.  However, if the \"B\" needed to be rendered textually, system-ui should be used.\n*   Font Weight: Bold.\n*   Font Size: Dynamically sized based on the `size` prop.\n\n*Spacing Measurements*:\n\n*   The internal padding and spacing within the icon are all proportionally derived from the `size` prop.  This ensures consistent scaling.\n\n*Responsive Behavior & Breakpoint Considerations*:\n\n*   The icon is inherently scalable due to its SVG nature.\n*   The `size` prop can be dynamically updated based on screen size using media queries or a responsive utility.\n\n*Interactive States & Micro-Interactions*:\n\n*   The design doesn't indicate any specific interactive states. However, the component could be enhanced with hover or focus effects in the future (e.g., a subtle color change or scaling animation).\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n*Functional Requirements*:\n\n*   The component renders the Bootstrap Card icon correctly.\n*   The `size` prop controls the icon's dimensions.\n*   The `color` prop controls the icon's fill color.\n*   The `className` prop allows for adding custom CSS classes.\n*   The component is accessible to screen readers via the `aria-label` prop.\n\n*Visual Accuracy Requirements*:\n\n*   The icon's shape and proportions match the design.\n*   The fill color matches the specified design value (or approximates it if a gradient is involved).\n*   The icon scales smoothly without distortion.\n\n*Performance Benchmarks*:\n\n*   The component renders quickly and efficiently, without impacting page load time.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization & File Structure Recommendations*:\n\n*   Create a new file named `BootstrapCardIcon.tsx` within the `src/components/icons` directory (or the appropriate directory for icons within the design system).\n*   Export the component as the default export from the file.\n\n*Testing Strategy*:\n\n*   Unit tests should be written to verify the component's props and rendering logic.\n*   Visual regression tests should be used to ensure the icon renders correctly across different browsers and screen sizes.\n\n*Potential Gotchas & Implementation Challenges*:\n\n*   *Gradient Implementation*: Implementing the gradient effect precisely using CSS or SVG gradients might require experimentation and fine-tuning. Consider using a simplified flat color as an initial implementation.\n*   *Cross-Browser Compatibility*: Thoroughly test the component across different browsers to ensure consistent rendering.\n*   *Accessibility*:  Ensure the `aria-label` provides meaningful context for screen reader users.  If the icon is purely decorative, use `aria-hidden=\"true\"` instead.\n*   *Scaling*: When the size of the icon changes ensure the rendering remains crisp and sharp. Avoid blurry edges.\n*   *Naming conventions*: If an icon representing the Bootstrap Icon already exists, make sure the new icon is named descriptively to prevent naming conflict. For example, `BootstrapCardIcon` instead of `BootstrapIcon`.\n\n{{\n// BootstrapCardIcon.tsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\ninterface BootstrapCardIconProps {\n  size?: number;\n  color?: string;\n  className?: string;\n  ariaLabel?: string;\n}\n\nconst BootstrapCardIcon: React.FC<BootstrapCardIconProps> = ({\n  size = 24,\n  color = '#7952B3', // Placeholder - needs proper gradient implementation\n  className,\n  ariaLabel\n}) => {\n  const svgStyle = {\n    width: size,\n    height: size,\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <svg\n      xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n      width={size}\n      height={size}\n      viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" // Corrected viewBox\n      style={svgStyle}\n      className={className}\n      aria-label={ariaLabel}\n    >\n      <path d=\"M0 4a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v8a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H2a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V4zm4 0a.5.5 0 0 0-.5.5v7a.5.5 0 0 0 .5.5H8a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V4.5a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H4z\"/>\n    </svg>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default BootstrapCardIcon;\n\n}}\n\n*Note*: The above code provides a basic SVG implementation. This should render as a square. The path element renders a rectangle with rounded edges. Consider using an actual Bootstrap SVG icon to replace the path for a more accurate render. Also, the color is a placeholder.  The correct gradient needs to be implemented.\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement Chakra UI Modal Component\n\nThis ticket defines the implementation of a Chakra UI-based modal component within our Angular application. Modals provide a crucial overlay interface, allowing users to focus on a specific task or piece of information without navigating away from the current page. A well-implemented modal enhances user experience by providing clear context and guided interactions.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Angular Implementation Strategy*:\nThe component will be implemented as a standalone Angular component utilizing Chakra UI's modal directives. This ensures consistency with our existing design system and leverages Chakra's accessibility features.\n\n*Component Architecture and Data Flow*:\nThe component will be designed to be reusable, accepting input properties to control its visibility, title, body content, and action buttons. An `EventEmitter` will be used to signal when the modal is closed and to pass any relevant data back to the parent component.\n\n*Design System Integration*:\nWe will leverage existing Chakra UI theme tokens for consistent styling (colors, typography, spacing). Custom CSS classes will be added only when necessary to override default Chakra UI styles or implement custom behaviors.\n\n*Performance Considerations*:\nThe modal content will be rendered lazily using `*ngIf` to prevent unnecessary DOM updates when the modal is hidden. We will ensure that the modal's backdrop is not unnecessarily re-rendering.\n\n*Accessibility Considerations*:\nWe will ensure that the modal adheres to ARIA best practices, including setting appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) and providing keyboard navigation support (e.g., using `tabindex` to trap focus within the modal). Focus will be managed such that focus is automatically given to the first tabbable item when opening, and returned to the element that opened the modal when closed.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Palette*:\n* Component Fill 1: #309694\n* Component Fill 2: #FFFFFF\n\n*Typography*:\n* Font Family: Inter\n* Font Size: 16px\n\n*Spacing*:\n* Base Spacing Units: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px (adhering to the identified pattern)\n\n*Layout and Structure*:\nThe modal will use Chakra UI's `Modal`, `ModalOverlay`, `ModalContent`, `ModalHeader`, `ModalBody`, and `ModalFooter` components to structure the layout.  Given the blank blue screenshot, the initial implementation will focus on structure and basic functionality. More visual styling will be added in subsequent tickets with clearer visual requirements.\n\n*Responsive Behavior*:\nThe modal's width and positioning will be adjusted based on screen size using Chakra UI's responsive syntax. On smaller screens, the modal will occupy a larger portion of the screen, potentially becoming full-screen on mobile devices.\n\n*Interactive States*:\nThe modal will have at least two interactive states: open and closed. Future tickets should address hover and focus states for any action buttons within the modal.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n*Functional Requirements*:\n* The modal should open when triggered by an event from a parent component.\n* The modal should close when the user clicks the close button, clicks the backdrop, or presses the Escape key.\n* The modal should trap focus within its content when open.\n* An event should be emitted to the parent component when the modal is closed.\n\n*Visual Accuracy*:\n* The modal's background color should match the specified design (#309694 for the overlay/backdrop).\n* The text within the modal should use the Inter font at 16px.\n* Spacing should adhere to the defined spacing units (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px).\n\n*Performance Benchmarks*:\n* The modal should open and close smoothly without noticeable lag.\n* The component should not introduce any performance regressions to the application.\n\n*Accessibility*:\n* The modal should be fully accessible via keyboard navigation.\n* All interactive elements within the modal should have appropriate ARIA attributes.\n* Screen readers should correctly announce the modal's content and purpose.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization*:\nCreate a dedicated `modal` folder within our `shared` directory. The component's files should follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `modal.component.ts`, `modal.component.html`, `modal.component.scss`).\n\n*Testing Strategy*:\nWrite unit tests to verify the component's functionality, including:\n* Opening and closing the modal\n* Emitting events to the parent component\n* Trapping focus within the modal\n* Integration tests that verify the modal works correctly within a sample application context.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges*:\n* Chakra UI's modal component relies on React Context under the hood.  Ensure the Angular component is correctly consuming this context.\n* Managing focus within the modal can be tricky. Pay close attention to keyboard navigation and ensure that focus is returned to the correct element when the modal is closed.\n* Be mindful of Z-index conflicts with other components on the page. Set the modal's Z-index high enough to ensure it is always displayed on top.\n* Consider potential performance implications if the modal contains a large amount of content. Implement lazy loading or virtualization if necessary.\n",

      "aiResponse": "Here's a JIRA ticket based on the visual screenshot and design information provided.\n\nh1. 🎯 Implement Material Design Button Component\n\nThis ticket defines the implementation of a Material Design Button component in AEM. This interactive button will allow users to trigger specific actions within the application. This provides a consistent, accessible, and visually appealing button experience aligned with Material Design principles, improving overall UX and usability.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy*:\n\n*   Develop an AEM component using HTL (Sightly) for the markup and Sling Models (Java) for the backend logic.\n*   Leverage AEM's built-in features for component dialog configuration, allowing authors to customize button text and link destination.\n*   Implement the button styling using ClientLibs (CSS) to ensure consistent styling across the application. Utilize AEM style system for flexibility.\n\n*Component Architecture*:\n\n*   Sling Model: Contains logic for retrieving button text, link URL, and any other relevant data.\n*   HTL Template: Generates the HTML markup for the button, applying CSS classes based on the data from the Sling Model.\n*   ClientLibs: Contains the CSS styles for the button, defining its appearance and interactive states.\n\n*Data Flow*:\n\n1.  Content author configures the button through the AEM component dialog, setting the button text and target URL.\n2.  When the page is rendered, the Sling Model retrieves this information from the JCR.\n3.  The HTL template uses the data from the Sling Model to generate the button markup.\n4.  The ClientLibs provide the CSS styles to render the button visually.\n\n*Integration with Design System*:\n\n*   The button's styling will be consistent with the existing Material Design System.\n*   Utilize AEM's Style System to allow content authors to apply predefined styles. This will enforce design consistency and allow customization within defined boundaries.\n*   The color palette, typography, and spacing measurements from the provided design analysis will be strictly adhered to.\n\n*Performance Considerations*:\n\n*   The CSS for the button will be optimized and minified to reduce file size.\n*   Lazy loading is not applicable as the button will typically be visible on initial page load.\n*   Ensure Javascript is not included unless there are dynamic features like tracking.\n\n*Accessibility Considerations*:\n\n*   Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<button>` or `<a>` element with appropriate `role=\"button\"` for accessibility reasons).\n*   Provide sufficient color contrast between the button text and background.\n*   Ensure the button is keyboard accessible (focusable and operable using the keyboard).\n*   Use ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) to provide additional context to assistive technologies, if needed.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values*:\n\n*   Component fill 1: `#1a75d1` (Primary button background color)\n*   Component fill 2: `#ffffff` (Button text color, likely for primary button state)\n\n*Typography*:\n\n*   Font Family: Roboto\n*   Font Size: 14px\n\n*Spacing*:\n\n*   Use the defined spacing patterns (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px) for padding, margins, and other spacing.\n\n*States*:\n\n*   *Default:* Button with the primary background color and white text.\n*   *Hover:* (Not visible in screenshot, but crucial) Slightly darken the background color or introduce a subtle animation to indicate hover state.\n*   *Focus:* Add a visual focus indicator (e.g., a border or outline) to indicate keyboard focus.\n*   *Disabled:* (Not visible in screenshot, but crucial) Greyed-out appearance with reduced opacity and disabled click functionality.\n\n*Responsive Behavior*:\n* No breakpoints are defined, the component needs to scale appropriatly for mobile.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n*Functional Requirements*:\n\n*   Button text should be configurable through the AEM component dialog.\n*   The button should link to the URL specified in the component dialog.\n*   The button should respond to clicks by navigating to the specified URL.\n*   Hovering over the button should change its appearance to indicate the hover state.\n*   The button should be keyboard accessible, focusable with Tab, and clickable with Enter or Space.\n*   If configured as disabled, the button should not be clickable and should have a distinct visual appearance.\n\n*Visual Accuracy*:\n\n*   The button should match the visual design specified in the screenshot, including color, typography, and spacing.\n*   The hover and focus states should be visually distinct.\n\n*Performance*:\n\n*   The button's CSS should be optimized and not negatively impact page load time.\n\n*Accessibility*:\n\n*   The button should be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG guidelines.\n*   Color contrast should meet accessibility standards.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization*:\n\n*   Create a dedicated folder for the Material Design Button component within the AEM project (e.g., `/apps/myproject/components/material-design-button`).\n*   Use separate files for the Sling Model (Java), HTL template, CSS, and component dialog definition.\n\n*Testing Strategy*:\n\n*   *Unit Tests:* Write unit tests for the Sling Model to ensure it correctly retrieves and processes data.\n*   *Integration Tests:* Verify that the component integrates correctly with AEM and that the button renders as expected.\n*   *UI Tests:* Use Selenium or similar tools to automate testing of the button's functionality and appearance across different browsers and devices.\n*   *Accessibility Tests:* Use accessibility testing tools to verify that the button is accessible to users with disabilities.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges*:\n\n*   *CSS Specificity:* Ensure that the button's CSS styles are specific enough to override any conflicting styles from the AEM core components or other ClientLibs.\n*   *Accessibility:* Pay careful attention to accessibility requirements, especially color contrast and keyboard navigation.  Ensure a developer tests this with a screen reader.\n*   *AEM Style System:* Make sure the styling is applied as part of the AEM style system for optimal user flexibility.\n*   *Cross-Browser Compatibility:* Test the button in multiple browsers to ensure consistent rendering and functionality.\n*   *Touch Devices*: Properly simulate :hover states on touch devices.  Potentially use a different visual change on click.\n\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement the Bootstrap Card Component\n\nThis ticket defines the requirements for a reusable Bootstrap Card component in React TypeScript.  This component will serve as a flexible container for displaying various content types (text, images, links).  Its business value lies in providing a consistent and visually appealing way to present information across the application, improving user experience and maintainability.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*React TypeScript Implementation:*\n\nWe will implement the Bootstrap Card as a functional component using React TypeScript. This approach ensures type safety and promotes code reusability. We'll leverage existing styling solutions (e.g., styled-components or CSS modules) to manage the component's visual appearance.\n\n*Component Architecture & Data Flow:*\n\nThe component will be designed to be highly configurable through props.  These props will control the card's content, appearance, and behavior.\n\nData Flow: Parent Component -> Bootstrap Card Component (via props). The card component itself will likely not manage any internal state.\n\n*Design System Integration:*\n\nThe component's styles should adhere to the existing design system.  We should leverage the defined color palette (#f7fafa and #212629) and typography styles from the design system to ensure visual consistency across the application.\n\n*Performance Considerations:*\n\nSince the component's content is passed in as props, performance should not be a major concern. However, if the component will be used to display large images or complex data structures, we may need to consider lazy loading or virtualization techniques.\n\n*Accessibility Considerations:*\n\nWe will ensure that the component is accessible by adhering to WCAG guidelines. This includes providing appropriate ARIA attributes, ensuring keyboard navigability, and maintaining sufficient color contrast. Focus states need to be clearly visible if card has interactive elements.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Visual Attributes:*\n\n*   *Background Color:* Based on screenshot fill detected, use #f7fafa for the card's background.\n*   *Text Color:* Use #212629 for the primary text color inside the card.\n*   *Typography:* Adhere to the system-ui font and size range defined in the design specs. Ensure that the font hierarchy (Primary -> Secondary -> Caption) is properly implemented.\n*   *Spacing:* Implement the specified spacing patterns (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px) to ensure consistent spacing between elements within the card.\n*   *Border/Shadow:* While not explicitly stated, analyze common Bootstrap card implementations for a subtle border and/or shadow.\n\n*Responsive Behavior:*\n\nThe Bootstrap Card component should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. Consider using CSS media queries to adjust the component's layout and spacing at different breakpoints.\n\n*Interactive States:*\n\nIf the card is clickable or contains interactive elements, define appropriate hover and focus states. Ensure that these states are visually distinct and provide clear feedback to the user.  This will require styling for `:hover` and `:focus` pseudo-classes in the styling solution.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n*Functional Requirements:*\n\n*   The component should render the content passed in via props correctly.\n*   The component should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.\n*   If applicable, hover and focus states should be visually distinct and functional.\n\n*Visual Accuracy:*\n\n*   The component should visually match the design specifications in terms of color, typography, spacing, and layout.\n*   All elements within the card should be properly aligned and sized.\n\n*Accessibility:*\n\n*   The component should be keyboard navigable.\n*   All interactive elements should have appropriate ARIA attributes.\n*   Sufficient color contrast should be maintained between text and background colors.\n\n*Performance:*\n\n*   The component should render quickly and efficiently.\n*   Lazy loading or virtualization should be implemented if the component is used to display large images or complex data structures.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization & File Structure:*\n\nCreate a `components` directory and place the `BootstrapCard.tsx` file inside it.  Create a corresponding `BootstrapCard.styles.ts` or `BootstrapCard.module.css` for styling.\n\n*Testing Strategy:*\n\nWrite unit tests to verify the component's functionality and visual appearance. Use a testing library such as Jest and React Testing Library. Consider visual regression testing to catch visual regressions.\n\n*Potential Gotchas & Implementation Challenges:*\n\n*   *Styling Conflicts:* Be mindful of potential styling conflicts with other components or global styles. Use CSS modules or styled-components to encapsulate the component's styles.\n*   *Responsive Behavior:* Thoroughly test the component's responsive behavior on different devices and screen sizes.\n*   *Accessibility:* Ensure that all accessibility requirements are met by using a linting tool such as ESLint with the `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` plugin.\n*   *Dynamic Content:* The card may need to handle different types of content. Type the props carefully with TypeScript and use conditional rendering as needed. E.g.,\n{{\ninterface BootstrapCardProps {\n   title: string;\n   body?: string; // optional\n   imageUrl?: string; //optional\n   ctaLink?: string;  //optional\n}\n}}\n\n*   *Implementation of the specific card shape:*  Replicating the exact rounded/curved corners and the subtle outline around the card in the screenshot might require some experimentation with `border-radius` and `box-shadow` CSS properties. Consider using a utility library like `clsx` to dynamically apply Bootstrap classes alongside custom styles.\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement Reusable Chakra UI Modal Component\n\nThis ticket outlines the development of a reusable Angular component based on the Chakra UI Modal design. This modal will provide a consistent and accessible overlay for focused user interactions throughout the application, improving user experience and maintaining design consistency. This promotes a more streamlined workflow for users by presenting information clearly and concisely, preventing context switching unnecessarily.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy:*\n\n*   Create an Angular component leveraging Chakra UI's `Modal` component. We will use the component composition pattern in Angular to make the modal highly configurable. This involves using `<ng-content>` to project content into the modal body, header, and footer.\n*   Implement a service to manage the modal's visibility state. This will allow components across the application to open and close the modal without direct access to the component instance.\n*   Provide a configuration object for customization, including modal size, header title, and button actions.\n\n*Component Architecture:*\n\n1.  `ModalService`: A singleton service responsible for controlling modal visibility and passing configuration. This service will expose methods to open and close the modal.\n2.  `ModalComponent`: An Angular component that encapsulates the Chakra UI `Modal` component. It will receive configuration from the `ModalService` and render the modal with the provided content and actions.\n3.  Dynamic Content Projection: Utilize `<ng-content select=\"[modal-header]\"></ng-content>`, `<ng-content select=\"[modal-body]\"></ng-content>`, and `<ng-content select=\"[modal-footer]\"></ng-content>` to allow developers to inject content into designated areas of the modal.\n\n*Data Flow:*\n\n1.  A component requests the modal to open via the `ModalService.open(config)`.\n2.  The `ModalService` updates its internal state, including the `config` object and a boolean `isOpen` flag.\n3.  The `ModalComponent`, subscribed to the `ModalService`, detects the change in state and renders the Chakra UI `Modal`.\n4.  The `ModalComponent` projects provided content using `<ng-content>`.\n5.  User interacts with the modal, triggering actions that may close the modal via `ModalService.close()`.\n\n*Design System Integration:*\n\n*   Adhere to existing color palettes (specifically `#309694` and `#ffffff`), typography (Inter font, 16px), and spacing guidelines (multiples of 4px) as identified in the design analysis.\n*   Leverage Chakra UI's theming capabilities to ensure consistency with the overall application theme.\n*   Create Storybook stories for the modal component to demonstrate its usage and variations.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility:*\n\n*   Ensure proper focus management within the modal for keyboard navigation.\n*   Implement ARIA attributes to properly convey the modal's role to screen readers (e.g., `aria-modal=\"true\"`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`).\n*   The modal content should be lazy-loaded if it contains heavy components, to avoid initial load delays.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values:*\n*   Modal Background: `#ffffff`\n*   Primary Action Button Background: `#309694`\n\n*Typography:*\n*   Font Family: Inter\n*   Font Size: 16px (body text, button labels)\n\n*Spacing:*\n*   Padding within the modal: Use multiples of 4px (e.g., 16px, 24px) to maintain visual harmony. Pay close attention to spacing between header, body, and footer.\n\n*Responsive Behavior:*\n*   The modal should adapt to different screen sizes. Consider using Chakra UI's responsive styles (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) to adjust the modal's width and position based on the viewport.\n*   On smaller screens, the modal may take up the full screen to ensure readability and usability.\n\n*Interactive States:*\n*   Button hover/focus states should use a slightly darker shade of `#309694` to provide visual feedback.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n*Functional:*\n*   The modal should open when `ModalService.open(config)` is called with a valid configuration object.\n*   The modal should close when `ModalService.close()` is called or when the user clicks the close button (if present).\n*   Content projected into the modal using `<ng-content>` should be rendered correctly.\n*   Buttons within the modal should trigger the appropriate actions as defined in the configuration object.\n*   The modal should trap focus, preventing users from interacting with elements outside the modal when it is open.\n\n*Visual:*\n*   The modal should visually match the provided design screenshot. Specific attention should be paid to colors, typography, and spacing.\n*   The modal should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.\n*   Button styles should match the application's design system.\n\n*Performance:*\n*   The modal should open and close smoothly without noticeable lag.\n*   Lazy loading should be implemented for complex modal content.\n\n*Accessibility:*\n*   The modal should be fully accessible to users with disabilities, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.\n*   All interactive elements within the modal should have appropriate ARIA attributes.\n*   Contrast ratios should meet WCAG AA guidelines.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization:*\n*   Create a dedicated module for the modal component (e.g., `ModalModule`).\n*   Store the `ModalService` in a separate file (e.g., `modal.service.ts`).\n*   Create a shared interface (e.g. `ModalConfig`) to strongly type the modal configuration object.\n\n*Testing Strategy:*\n*   Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the `ModalService` and `ModalComponent`.\n*   Use integration tests to ensure that the modal integrates correctly with other components in the application.\n*   Perform end-to-end tests to verify the modal's accessibility and responsiveness.\n\n*Potential Gotchas:*\n*   Ensure that the modal's `z-index` is high enough to prevent it from being obscured by other elements on the page.\n*   Be mindful of the performance implications of rendering complex content within the modal.\n*   Thoroughly test the modal on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.\n*   Carefully manage subscriptions to the `ModalService` to prevent memory leaks. Consider using the `takeUntil` operator to unsubscribe when the component is destroyed.\n",

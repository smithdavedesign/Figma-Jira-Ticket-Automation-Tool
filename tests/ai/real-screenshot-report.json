      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Create Material Design Button Component in AEM\n\nThis ticket outlines the development of a Material Design Button component for AEM. This component will provide a consistent and accessible button experience across the platform, enhancing user interaction and adhering to Material Design principles. The button will support various states (default, hover, active, disabled) and be customizable with different text labels. Business value is improved usability and a consistent user experience.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\nThe implementation will leverage AEM's component framework. The component will be built using HTL (Sightly) for templating and Sling Models for data retrieval.  The visual styling will be achieved using CSS, adhering to the AEM project's existing style guide where possible, and potentially leveraging ClientLibs for efficient delivery.\n\n*Component Architecture*: The button component will consist of:\n\n*   HTL template: `materialbutton.html` - responsible for rendering the button's structure.\n*   Sling Model: `MaterialButtonModel.java` - responsible for retrieving content (button text, link URL, disabled state).\n*   CSS: `materialbutton.css` - responsible for the button's styling, including states and responsiveness.\n*   Edit Dialog:  Configurable options such as button text, link, and style variations\n\n*Data Flow*:  The Sling Model will retrieve the button's content from the JCR repository, populated via the AEM authoring UI. This data will be passed to the HTL template for rendering.\n\n*Integration with Design System*:  We will need to ensure the component integrates seamlessly with the existing AEM design system. This includes:\n    *   Using existing color palettes if applicable. The design specifies #1a75d1 and #ffffff. We need to ensure this matches the existing color tokens in the AEM style system. If not, we need to create new color tokens, rather than hardcoding values.\n    *   Adhering to existing typography styles. The design specifies Roboto 14px.\n    *   Maintaining consistent spacing and layout using the provided patterns (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px).\n*Performance*: Client-side performance will be optimized by minifying and combining CSS and JavaScript.  Lazy loading is not directly relevant for this small component.\n*Accessibility*: Accessibility is a key requirement.  The button will:\n    *   Use semantic HTML (`<button>` or `<a>` with `role=\"button\"`).\n    *   Provide appropriate ARIA attributes for disabled states (`aria-disabled=\"true\"`).\n    *   Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background.\n    *   Be fully keyboard accessible (focus state styling, correct tab order).\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values*:\n    *   Primary Color (Component Fill 1): #1a75d1. Use as background color for the default state. This should be mapped to a color token in the design system.\n    *   Secondary Color (Component Fill 2): #ffffff. Use as text color for the default state.  This should also be mapped to a color token.\n*Typography*:\n    *   Font Family: Roboto.  Ensure this font is loaded and available in the AEM environment.\n    *   Font Size: 14px.\n    *   Font Weight: Medium/Regular (to be confirmed during design review).\n*Spacing*:\n    *   Padding: Apply consistent padding around the button text, adhering to the 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px spacing patterns.  Specific values will depend on the button size (standard, small, large). The visual design does not give clues about sizing, so we must assume default size.\n*Responsive Behavior*: The button should adapt to different screen sizes. At a minimum:\n    *   Text should wrap appropriately on smaller screens.\n    *   Consider adding a \"full-width\" option for smaller screens via the Edit Dialog.\n*Interactive States*:\n    *   *Hover*: Darken the background color slightly (e.g., using `rgba()` to overlay a semi-transparent black).\n    *   *Active (Pressed)*: Further darken the background color, and potentially add a subtle shadow.\n    *   *Disabled*: Reduce opacity to 50% and disable click events (pointer-events: none).\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n*Functional Requirements*:\n    *   The button should trigger the associated link when clicked (if a link is provided).\n    *   The button should be disabled when the \"disabled\" property is set in the AEM authoring UI.\n    *   The button text should be configurable through the AEM authoring UI.\n    *   The button should be accessible via keyboard navigation.\n*Visual Accuracy*:\n    *   The button should match the visual design in terms of color, typography, spacing, and interactive states.\n    *   The button should render correctly in all supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n*Accessibility*:\n    *   The button should have sufficient color contrast ratio (at least 4.5:1 for normal text).\n    *   The button should be properly labeled for screen readers.\n    *   The button should be focusable and operable using the keyboard.\n*Performance*:\n    *   The button should not introduce any significant performance regressions.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization*:\n    *   Use a well-structured folder hierarchy for the component (e.g., `/apps/myproject/components/materialbutton`).\n    *   Separate CSS rules into logical blocks (e.g., default styles, hover styles, disabled styles).\n    *   Use meaningful class names that follow a consistent naming convention (BEM or similar).\n*Testing Strategy*:\n    *   Unit tests for the Sling Model to ensure data retrieval is correct.\n    *   Integration tests to verify the component renders correctly in AEM.\n    *   Manual testing to check visual accuracy, accessibility, and interactive states.\n*Potential Gotchas*:\n    *   Ensure proper escaping of user-provided button text to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n    *   Carefully manage CSS specificity to avoid conflicts with other styles on the page.\n    *   Thoroughly test the component in different AEM environments (dev, staging, production).\n    *   Ensure that the Roboto font is properly configured and delivered within AEM for consistent rendering. Consider font loading strategies to prevent FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text).\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Task: Implement Bootstrap Icon Card\n\n- *Description:* This task involves creating a reusable React TypeScript component for a \"Bootstrap Icon Card.\" This component will display a Bootstrap-themed icon within a card-like container with a distinct shape and color scheme. This component serves as a visual representation, likely a shortcut, to Bootstrap's resources.\n- *Business Value:* Provides a visual and intuitive entry point to Bootstrap resources or sections within the application, improving user experience and navigation. Enables consistency in design and promotes discoverability of Bootstrap functionality.\n- *User Impact:* Users can quickly identify and access Bootstrap functionalities within the application through a visual and standardized icon representation.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy:*\n- Use React TypeScript to create a strongly-typed, reusable component.\n- Leverage existing component libraries where appropriate (e.g., `styled-components` or similar CSS-in-JS library for styling) to avoid writing raw CSS. This promotes consistency and maintainability.\n- The shape of the card will likely require either complex CSS or an SVG. SVG is preferred for scalability and crisp rendering across different resolutions.\n- The component should be flexible enough to accept different icons and custom styling options.\n\n*Component Architecture:*\n- The component will consist of a primary container (`div` or `styled.div`) that acts as the card.\n- Inside, it will contain an SVG for the card shape and another component (likely an `Icon` component if one exists, or an `img` element) to display the Bootstrap icon ('B' in this example).\n- Consider creating an interface (`BootstrapIconCardProps`) to define the types of props the component accepts (e.g., `iconName`, `iconColor`, `backgroundColor`, `size`, `onClick`, etc.).\n\n*Data Flow:*\n- The component will receive data primarily through props. The most important props will be the `icon` and optionally `iconColor` and `backgroundColor`.\n- The component likely does not require any internal state unless hover/active states need to be managed.\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System:*\n- Ensure that the color palette, typography (for any supporting text that might be added later), and spacing adhere to the existing design system.\n- If a global `Icon` component exists, reuse it. If not, investigate creating one to maintain consistency.\n\n*Performance Considerations:*\n- SVG optimization: Minimize the SVG file size to ensure fast rendering.\n- If the icon card renders repeatedly, consider using `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n\n*Accessibility Considerations:*\n- If the icon acts as a link or button, ensure appropriate ARIA roles (e.g., `role=\"link\"` or `role=\"button\"`) and attributes (`aria-label` for screen readers).\n- Ensure sufficient color contrast between the icon and background for users with visual impairments.\n- Keyboard navigation should be considered if the card is interactive; ensure the card is focusable and that focus is visually apparent.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values:*\n- Background color: #f7fafa (Component fill 1)\n- Icon Color: Likely white (implied by the screenshot, not specified)\n- Card Background:  Gradient purple (not specified, needs to be derived from design assets if available)\n- Component fill 2 is #212629 (Component fill 2), unclear where this is used, might be a shadow.\n\n*Typography Specs:*\n- Font: system-ui\n- Size: Not applicable in the screenshot, but define sizes for any labels if applicable in future enhancements.\n\n*Layout & Spacing:*\n- The 'B' icon should be visually centered within the card area.  Define padding/margin appropriately to achieve this.  Leverage the 4px, 8px, 16px spacing system.\n\n*Responsive Behavior:*\n- The icon card may need to scale proportionally on different screen sizes. Implement using CSS media queries or a responsive utility from a CSS-in-JS library.\n\n*Interactive States:*\n- Implement hover and active states to provide visual feedback on user interaction. This can be achieved with simple CSS `:hover` and `:active` selectors or equivalent logic in the `styled-components` library.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n*Functional Requirements:*\n- [ ] The component renders a Bootstrap-themed icon within a shaped card.\n- [ ] The icon and background colors are configurable via props.\n- [ ] The component responds to click events (if `onClick` prop is provided).\n- [ ] The card must maintain aspect ratio and scale responsively across common screen sizes.\n- [ ] If interactive, the card must be keyboard accessible.\n*Visual Accuracy:*\n- [ ] The rendered card shape matches the design specification (using SVG or precise CSS).\n- [ ] The icon is centered and visually appealing.\n- [ ] Colors match the specified color palette in the design.\n- [ ] Hover/active states provide clear visual feedback.\n*Performance:*\n- [ ] The component renders quickly and does not introduce performance bottlenecks.\n*Accessibility:*\n- [ ] The component is accessible via keyboard navigation (if interactive).\n- [ ] The component has appropriate ARIA attributes for screen reader users.\n- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG guidelines.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization:*\n- Create a dedicated folder for the component (e.g., `src/components/BootstrapIconCard`).\n- Create separate files for the component logic (`BootstrapIconCard.tsx`), styles (`BootstrapIconCard.styled.ts`), and types (`BootstrapIconCard.types.ts`).\n\n*Testing Strategy:*\n- Write unit tests to verify the component's rendering and behavior.\n- Use screenshot testing to ensure visual consistency across different browsers and environments.\n- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility (if interactive).\n\n*Potential Gotchas:*\n- Complex SVG shapes can be challenging to create and optimize.\n- Ensuring consistent styling across different browsers may require vendor prefixes or CSS resets.\n-  Getting the correct color gradient for the card background, if it's not a solid color, could be tricky. Use design tools to extract the exact color stops.\n-  Confirm how the \"B\" icon should be rendered.  Should it be an SVG, a font icon, or simply text?  SVG is preferred for flexibility.\n\n*File Structure Example:*\n{panel:title=Example File Structure}\nsrc/components/BootstrapIconCard/\n├── BootstrapIconCard.tsx\n├── BootstrapIconCard.styled.ts\n├── BootstrapIconCard.types.ts\n└── BootstrapIconCard.test.tsx\n{panel}\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement Chakra UI Modal Component\n\nThis ticket outlines the implementation of a Chakra UI Modal component within our Angular application. This modal will provide a consistent and accessible way to display focused content and gather user input in overlay scenarios. The implementation will prioritize adherence to the existing design system, accessibility best practices, and performance optimization.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy:*\n\nThe modal will be implemented as a reusable Angular component utilizing Chakra UI's modal components. This leverages the pre-built accessibility features and styling capabilities of Chakra UI. We will encapsulate the specific design requirements within our component, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.\n\n*Component Architecture:*\n\nThe component will receive data via `@Input()` properties, allowing it to be configured dynamically. We anticipate needing inputs for:\n* `isOpen`: Boolean indicating whether the modal is visible.\n* `onClose`:  A function to be called when the modal is closed (e.g., via the close button, backdrop click, or Escape key).\n* `title`:  The modal title (String).\n* `size`:  (Optional) Size of the modal (e.g., `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `full`). Defaults to `md`. This will be a Chakra UI size property.\n* `isCentered`: (Optional) Centers the modal on the screen. Boolean. Defaults to true. This will be a Chakra UI property.\n\nThe component will likely emit an event using `@Output()` for actions taken within the modal, allowing parent components to react accordingly.  For example, a 'submit' event with data.\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System:*\n\nWe will leverage our existing Chakra UI theme to ensure consistent styling.  Specific color and typography values will be pulled from the theme where available.  If custom styling is required beyond the theme, we will document it clearly and consider adding it to the theme for future use.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations:*\n\nChakra UI modals provide built-in accessibility features, including ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. We will ensure these features are properly configured. The modal content should be rendered only when the modal is open (conditionally rendered using `*ngIf`) to prevent unnecessary DOM rendering.  For complex modal content, consider lazy loading modules.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\nBased on the screenshot provided (and assuming a typical modal structure):\n\n*Colors:*\n\n* Background color for the modal: #ffffff (Component fill 2)\n* A potentially used secondary color: #309694 (Component fill 1)\n\n*Typography:*\n\n* Title: Inter, 16px (Assumed primary typography)\n* Body text: Inter, likely smaller than 16px (Assumed secondary or caption)\n\n*Spacing:*\n\n* The screenshot does not show the contents of the modal. Assuming standard modal padding, we will apply padding values from our spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px) following the provided pattern. A reasonable default padding might be 24px.\n* Margin between modal elements (title, content, buttons) will also adhere to the spacing scale.\n\n*Responsive Behavior:*\n\n* Modal sizing should be responsive, potentially using Chakra UI's responsive props to adjust width at different breakpoints.\n* Content within the modal should reflow appropriately on smaller screens.\n\n*Interactive States:*\n\n* Ensure proper focus styling for interactive elements (buttons, form fields).\n* The close button should have a hover and active state.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n*Functional Requirements:*\n\n* The modal should open and close correctly when `isOpen` is set to `true` and `false` respectively.\n* The `onClose` function should be called when the modal is closed via the close button, backdrop click, or Escape key.\n* The modal title should be displayed correctly.\n* If a `size` input is provided, it should be applied to the Chakra UI modal.\n* The modal should be vertically centered when `isCentered` is set to `true`.\n* The modal content should be rendered only when the modal is open.\n\n*Visual Accuracy Requirements:*\n\n* Colors, typography, and spacing should match the design specification (or the design system defaults if specific specs are not available).\n* The modal should be centered on the screen.\n* Interactive elements should have appropriate hover and active states.\n* Modal content should reflow correctly on different screen sizes.\n\n*Performance Benchmarks:*\n\n* The modal should open and close smoothly, with no noticeable lag.\n* The modal should not negatively impact the performance of other components on the page.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization and File Structure:*\n\n* Create a dedicated directory for the modal component (e.g., `src/app/components/modal`).\n* Separate the component logic, template, and styles into separate files (`modal.component.ts`, `modal.component.html`, `modal.component.scss`).\n* Utilize shared components and services where appropriate.\n\n*Testing Strategy:*\n\n* Write unit tests to verify the component's logic, including data binding, event emission, and state management.\n* Write integration tests to ensure the component interacts correctly with other components and services.\n* Manually test the component in different browsers and on different devices.  Pay close attention to accessibility.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges:*\n\n* *Focus Management:*  Ensure focus is trapped within the modal when it is open, and that focus returns to the triggering element when the modal is closed. Chakra UI handles this to some extent, but validation is still required.\n* *Accessibility:* Verify that all interactive elements within the modal are accessible via keyboard and screen reader.\n* *Dynamic Content:*  If the modal content is dynamic (e.g., a form with dynamically added fields), ensure that the modal height adjusts correctly to accommodate the content.\n* *Z-index Conflicts:* Ensure the modal's z-index is high enough to appear above other elements on the page.\n",

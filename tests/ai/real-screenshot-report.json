      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement Material Design Button Component in AEM\n\nThis ticket outlines the development of a Material Design Button component for AEM. This component will allow content authors to easily add styled buttons to pages, enabling users to trigger actions and navigate within the site. The Material Design Button is a key element in our design system and provides a consistent and familiar user experience.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy*:\n\nThe component will be implemented as an AEM component using Sling Models for data population and HTL (Handlebars Template Language) for rendering. This allows for a clean separation of concerns and easy maintenance. We'll leverage AEM's Style System to allow authors to customize button appearance without requiring code changes.\n\n*Component Architecture and Data Flow*:\n\nThe component will consist of the following files:\n\n*   `button.html` (HTL template): Responsible for rendering the button element.\n*   `button.java` (Sling Model): Populates the button.html template with data.\n*   `_cq_dialog/.content.xml` (Dialog definition): Defines the authoring dialog for configuring the button.\n*   `_cq_design/.content.xml` (Design dialog definition): Defines styles configurable for all the instances of the component.\n*   `clientlib`: Provides the CSS and JavaScript for button functionality.\n\nThe data flow will be as follows:\n\n1.  Author configures the button in the AEM authoring environment using the dialog.\n2.  The configuration is stored in the JCR repository.\n3.  When the page is rendered, the Sling Model reads the configuration from the JCR repository.\n4.  The Sling Model populates the HTL template with the configuration data.\n5.  The HTL template renders the button element.\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System*:\n\nThe component will be integrated with the existing AEM design system by adhering to the established color palette, typography, and spacing guidelines.  We'll define the Material Design Button specific styles within the design system's client library. This ensures visual consistency across the site.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations*:\n\n*   *Performance*: The component will be optimized for performance by minimizing the amount of JavaScript and CSS that is loaded. We will lazy-load any associated client libraries.\n*   *Accessibility*: The component will be accessible to users with disabilities by implementing the following features:\n    *   Using semantic HTML elements for the button.\n    *   Providing appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers.\n    *   Ensuring that the button is keyboard accessible.\n    *   Providing sufficient color contrast.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values*:\n\n*   Component fill 1: #1a75d1 (primary button background)\n*   Component fill 2: #ffffff (text color, potentially button background in other states)\n\n*Typography*:\n\n*   Font: Roboto\n*   Size: 14px\n*   Weight: Medium (adjust based on visual emphasis in different states)\n\n*Spacing*:\n\nThe design uses a spacing scale based on multiples of 4px. The following measurements should be used: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, and 48px.  Specifically, padding and margins should adhere to this scale.\n\n*Responsive Behavior and Breakpoint Considerations*:\n\nThe button should adapt to different screen sizes by adjusting its size and spacing as needed. Consider using AEM's responsive grid system for layout and implement media queries in the CSS to handle breakpoint-specific styling adjustments. The button's text should wrap gracefully on smaller screens.\n\n*Interactive States and Micro-Interactions*:\n\nThe button should have the following interactive states:\n\n*   *Default*: The button is in its normal state. (As seen in provided screenshot).\n*   *Hover*: The button changes its appearance when the user hovers the mouse over it. This could be a subtle color change or a slight elevation effect.\n*   *Focus*: The button has a clear focus state when the user tabs to it using the keyboard. This is critical for accessibility.  This could be an outline, a background color change, or a subtle shadow.\n*   *Active*: The button changes its appearance when the user clicks on it. This could be a slight color change or a momentary animation.\n*   *Disabled*: The button is disabled and cannot be clicked. The appearance should be visually distinct from the enabled states, typically a grayed-out appearance.\n\nEach state will be implemented using CSS pseudo-classes (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, `:disabled`).  Consider a subtle transition effect (e.g., using `transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;`) for a smoother user experience between states.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n*Functional Requirements*:\n\n*   The button component can be added to any page in AEM.\n*   The author can configure the button's text, link, and style using the dialog.\n*   Clicking the button navigates the user to the specified link.\n*   The button correctly displays all interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled).\n*   The button functions correctly on all supported browsers and devices.\n\n*Visual Accuracy Requirements*:\n\n*   The button's appearance matches the design specification in terms of color, typography, and spacing.\n*   The button's appearance is consistent across all supported browsers and devices.\n*   The button's interactive states are visually distinct and intuitive.\n*   The button adheres to the spacing and layout guidelines defined in the design system.\n\n*Performance Benchmarks*:\n\n*   The component should not significantly impact page load time.\n*   The component should render quickly and efficiently.\n*   Client library size should be minimized.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization and File Structure Recommendations*:\n\nFollow the standard AEM component structure:\n\n{{code}}\n/apps\n  /my-project\n    /components\n      /content\n        /material-button\n          button.html\n          button.java\n          _cq_dialog\n            .content.xml\n          _cq_design\n            .content.xml\n          clientlib\n            /css\n              button.css\n            /js\n              button.js\n{{code}}\n\n*Testing Strategy Tailored to This Component Type*:\n\n*   *Unit tests*:  Write unit tests for the Sling Model to ensure that it correctly retrieves and processes data.\n*   *Integration tests*:  Write integration tests to verify that the component integrates correctly with the AEM platform.\n*   *UI tests*:  Write UI tests to verify that the component renders correctly and that its interactive states function as expected. Use AEM's Screenshot Tests to validate the visual appearance.\n*   *Accessibility tests*: Use automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe) and manual testing to ensure that the component is accessible to users with disabilities.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges*:\n\n*   *CSS Specificity*:  Be mindful of CSS specificity when styling the button.  Avoid using overly specific CSS selectors that could conflict with other styles on the page.  Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming conventions to manage CSS specificity.\n*   *JavaScript Framework Conflicts*: Ensure that the button's JavaScript does not conflict with other JavaScript frameworks used on the site (e.g., React, Angular). Use namespaces to avoid naming collisions.\n*   *AEM Style System Complexity*: Leverage the style system effectively to expose only configurable design options, and avoid allowing authors to unintentionally break the component's design. Thoroughly test different style combinations.\n*   *Touch Devices*:  Ensure hover states are correctly handled or suppressed on touch devices, as they don't have a true \"hover\" state.\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement Bootstrap Card Component in React TypeScript\n\nThis ticket defines the requirements for implementing a Bootstrap-style card component in React TypeScript. The component will act as a container for displaying structured information and should be visually consistent with the provided design. The immediate business value is standardization and reuse of UI elements across the application, improving user experience through visual consistency and reducing development time.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy:*\n\nWe will create a `BootstrapCard` component using React TypeScript. This component will be a wrapper around standard HTML elements, styled to mimic the appearance of a Bootstrap card. We will leverage styled-components or Emotion for styling to achieve better component isolation and maintainability. The component should be flexible enough to accept various types of content, including headings, body text, images, and buttons.\n\n*Component Architecture and Data Flow:*\n\nThe `BootstrapCard` component will be a presentational component, receiving all necessary data as props.\n- *Props:*\n    - `children`: ReactNode (for the card content)\n    - `className`: string (optional, for adding custom CSS classes)\n    - `title`: string (optional, for the card title)\n    - `header`: ReactNode (optional, custom header content, overrides `title`)\n    - `footer`: ReactNode (optional, custom footer content)\n    - `style`: React.CSSProperties (optional, for inline styles)\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System:*\n\nThe component will adhere to the existing design system by using the defined color palette (#f7fafa for background, #212629 for text – though the actual purple is not in the palette).  We need to define variables or constants for these colors within our design system (if not already present) and use them in the component's styling. Font styling and spacing will also align with the existing design system's specifications.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations:*\n\n- *Performance:* The component itself should not introduce any performance bottlenecks.  If the content within the card includes images, lazy loading might be considered at a higher level (outside the card component itself).\n- *Accessibility:*  Ensure proper semantic HTML is used (e.g., using `header`, `main`, `footer` elements appropriately).  Provide sufficient color contrast for text and background. If the card contains interactive elements, ensure they are keyboard accessible and have appropriate ARIA attributes.\n- Ensure the element is properly focused when selected.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values:*\n\n- Component Fill 1: #f7fafa (background color of card)\n- Component Fill 2: #212629 (text color – though not the primary color of the shown card example)\n- Main Card Color: Deep Purple (not specified in palette - requires design system update and new variable `purpleCard` for consistency)\n\n*Typography Specs:*\n\n- Font: system-ui (Use the appropriate system font stack in CSS)\n- Size: 16px (for body text, adjust heading sizes accordingly based on hierarchy)\n\n*Spacing Measurements:*\n\n- Padding: Use the design system's spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px) for consistent spacing within the card.  Pay particular attention to spacing between the card header, body, and footer.\n\n*Responsive Behavior and Breakpoint Considerations:*\n\nThe card itself should be responsive by default (i.e., fill its container). If the card contains complex content that requires specific layout adjustments at different screen sizes, these adjustments should be handled within the content itself, not within the `BootstrapCard` component.\n\n*Interactive States and Micro-Interactions:*\n\nThe base card is static, but if it contains buttons or links, these should have appropriate hover and focus states according to the design system.  The \"B\" graphic implies a link, and may need to include a hover state.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n- The `BootstrapCard` component renders correctly with the specified background color (#f7fafa) and text color (#212629). The main body purple needs to be correctly implemented with a color variable within our theme.\n- The component accepts `children` prop and renders it within the card body.\n- The component accepts optional `title` prop and renders it as a card header.\n- The component accepts optional `header` and `footer` props and renders them in the appropriate sections of the card. These should override the title prop if a header is supplied.\n- The component adheres to the specified font and spacing guidelines.\n- The component is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.\n- The component is accessible, with proper semantic HTML and sufficient color contrast.\n- The component passes all relevant unit tests.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization and File Structure Recommendations:*\n\n- Create a `components` directory (if one doesn't already exist).\n- Create a `BootstrapCard` directory within the `components` directory.\n- Create the following files:\n    - `BootstrapCard.tsx` (the main component file)\n    - `BootstrapCard.styles.ts` (for styled-components or Emotion styles)\n    - `BootstrapCard.test.tsx` (for unit tests)\n    - `index.ts` (for exporting the component)\n\n*Testing Strategy Tailored to This Component Type:*\n\n- Write unit tests to verify that the component renders correctly with different props.\n- Use snapshot testing to ensure that the component's visual appearance remains consistent over time.\n- Test the component's accessibility using automated accessibility testing tools.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges:*\n\n- Ensuring proper color contrast for text and background.\n- Handling different types of content within the card body.\n- Maintaining consistency with the existing design system.\n- Properly implementing styles using styled-components or Emotion, ensuring correct theming integration.\n- The purple color on the provided image is not a defined color. This will have to be added and a new variable added to the theme `purpleCard`. This requires design team input and a potential design system update.\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Executive Summary\n\nThis ticket outlines the development of a Chakra UI-based modal component for our Angular application.  The modal provides a focused user interface for critical interactions, enhancing user experience and streamlining workflows. Its correct implementation is key to maintaining a consistent and accessible user interface across our application. This component will initially be used to present focused forms, confirmation dialogs, and other critical user interactions, increasing task completion rates and reducing user error.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\nThe modal will be implemented as an Angular component leveraging Chakra UI's modal primitives. This provides built-in accessibility, theming, and responsiveness. We'll create a wrapper component to encapsulate the Chakra UI modal and provide a consistent API for use throughout the application.\n\n*Component Architecture:*\n\nThe component will be structured as follows:\n\n*   `modal.component.ts`:  Handles the modal's logic (opening, closing, data binding, event handling). This will take configuration options such as `title`, `content`, and `actions` as input properties, and emit events for actions such as `confirm` or `cancel`.\n*   `modal.component.html`:  Defines the modal's template, utilizing Chakra UI components for styling and structure.  This will leverage `ng-content` to project dynamic content into the modal body.\n*   `modal.component.scss`:  Contains component-specific styles, overriding Chakra UI defaults where necessary to match the provided design.\n*   `modal.module.ts`:  Declares and exports the modal component for use in other modules.\n\n*Data Flow:*\n\nThe modal's data flow will be unidirectional. Parent components will pass data into the modal via input properties. The modal will emit events to notify parent components of user actions.\n\n*Integration with Design System:*\n\nThe component will adhere to our existing design system. Chakra UI's theming capabilities will be used to ensure consistent styling across the application. We will define global Chakra UI theme overrides to apply our brand colors, typography, and spacing.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations:*\n\n*   *Lazy Loading:*  To improve initial page load performance, the modal component will be lazily loaded using Angular's `dynamic import()` syntax.\n*   *Accessibility:* Chakra UI provides excellent accessibility features.  We'll ensure proper ARIA attributes are used, and keyboard navigation is fully supported. Focus trapping will be implemented to prevent focus from escaping the modal.  The `aria-labelledby` attribute will be used to associate the modal title with the modal content.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values:*\n\n*   Component fill 1: `#309694` (Used for primary buttons/accents within the modal, if applicable)\n*   Component fill 2: `#ffffff` (Used for the modal background)\n\n*Typography Specs:*\n\n*   Font Family: Inter\n*   Font Size: 16px (Primary Body Text) - other sizes likely exist for the title and button labels; we'll need more information on those from a detailed spec.\n\n*Spacing Measurements:*\n\nThe design system uses a consistent spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px). These values should be used for padding, margin, and gap throughout the modal.  Pay close attention to the spacing between the modal's header, body, and footer.\n\n*Responsive Behavior:*\n\nThe modal should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. Chakra UI's responsive props will be used to adjust the modal's width and layout based on the current breakpoint.  Consider using a `useBreakpointValue` hook to adapt spacing or font sizes.\n\n*Interactive States:*\n\nThe modal should have clear visual cues for interactive elements, such as buttons and form fields. Use Chakra UI's `_hover`, `_focus`, and `_active` styles to provide feedback to the user.  For example, a button could slightly darken on hover.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n*Functional Requirements:*\n\n*   The modal should open and close correctly when triggered by the parent component.\n*   The modal's content should be dynamically rendered based on the input data provided by the parent component.\n*   Clicking outside the modal or pressing the \"Escape\" key should close the modal.\n*   Buttons within the modal should trigger the appropriate event emissions.\n*   Focus should be trapped within the modal when it is open.\n*   The modal's content should be scrollable if it exceeds the modal's height.\n\n*Visual Accuracy Requirements:*\n\n*   The modal's appearance should match the provided design, including colors, typography, and spacing.\n*   The modal should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.\n*   Interactive elements should have clear visual cues.\n\n*Performance Benchmarks:*\n\n*   The modal should open and close smoothly without noticeable lag.\n*   The modal's impact on initial page load time should be minimal (due to lazy loading).\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization and File Structure:*\n\nFollow the recommended Angular style guide for code organization and file structure. Use descriptive names for components, files, and variables.\n\n*Testing Strategy:*\n\n*   *Unit Tests:*  Write unit tests to verify the modal's logic, including its data binding, event handling, and state management.\n*   *Integration Tests:*  Write integration tests to ensure the modal integrates correctly with other components.\n*   *End-to-End Tests:*  Write end-to-end tests to verify the modal's overall functionality from a user perspective.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges:*\n\n*   *Chakra UI Theming:*  Customizing Chakra UI's theme can be complex. Refer to the Chakra UI documentation for guidance.\n*   *Focus Trapping:*  Implementing focus trapping correctly can be tricky. Use a library such as `focus-trap-react` or implement your own focus trapping logic.\n*   *Dynamic Content:*  Rendering dynamic content within the modal can lead to performance issues if not done carefully. Consider using Angular's `trackBy` function to optimize rendering.\n*   *Accessibility:*  Ensure the component meets WCAG standards for accessibility. Use a tool such as axe DevTools to identify accessibility issues.\n",

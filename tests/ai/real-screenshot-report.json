      "aiResponse": "# 🎯 Executive Summary & Business Context\n\nThis ticket outlines the implementation of a Chakra UI Modal component within an Angular application. Modals are crucial UI elements for focused user interaction, enabling actions like confirmations, alerts, or data entry without navigating away from the current page. The successful implementation of this modal will improve user experience by providing clear, contextual interfaces, thereby aligning with the general business goal of enhancing user satisfaction and engagement. This modal is critical for key user workflows and contributes to a modern, accessible user interface.\n\n## 🏢 Business Requirements & User Context\n\nThe Chakra UI Modal component will serve diverse use cases across the application, conforming to industry standards for modal dialogs. A primary user context involves situations where a user needs to confirm an action (e.g., deleting data), receive an alert (e.g., unsaved changes), or input data in a focused environment (e.g., creating a new item). Ensuring ease of use and accessibility is crucial, as users will interact with the modal in various contexts and may have diverse needs. The modal will streamline common business processes by providing intuitive prompts and interaction patterns.\n\n## 👤 User Experience Strategy\n\nThe UX strategy for this modal focuses on minimizing cognitive load and optimizing the multi-step user journey that often involves modal interactions. Clear and concise messaging is critical. Focus management is paramount; when the modal opens, focus should be trapped within the modal until it's closed. Visual hierarchy must clearly guide the user through the available actions, with a prominent primary action button. The design should minimize distractions and ensure users can quickly understand and complete their intended task. The modal should adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, maintaining a consistent and intuitive experience across devices.\n\n## 📋 Technical Analysis & Architecture\n\nImplementing the Chakra UI Modal in Angular involves leveraging the existing Chakra UI component library. Given the 'Medium-High' complexity assessment, the modal implementation will require careful consideration of state management, event handling, and accessibility features.\n\n**Angular Implementation Details:**\n\n1.  **Component Creation:** Create a new Angular component (e.g., `app-chakra-modal`) that encapsulates the Chakra UI Modal.\n2.  **Template Integration:** Use the Chakra UI Angular directives and components within the Angular template to render the modal structure.\n3.  **Data Binding:** Utilize Angular's data binding capabilities to pass necessary data (e.g., modal title, message, button labels) to the Chakra UI Modal component via `@Input()` properties.\n4.  **Event Handling:** Implement event handlers to manage modal open/close events and user interactions within the modal. Employ `@Output()` properties to emit events to the parent component when actions are performed within the modal (e.g., confirmation, cancellation).\n5.  **State Management:** Determine the appropriate state management approach. For simple modal states (open/closed), component-level state management using Angular's `useState` or RxJS Subjects is sufficient. For more complex scenarios involving data updates or interactions with other parts of the application, consider using a centralized state management solution like NgRx or Akita.\n6.  **Service Integration (Optional):** For complex modal interactions that require business logic or data fetching, consider creating a dedicated service (e.g., `ModalService`) that handles modal lifecycle management and interaction with backend APIs.\n\n**Code Example Snippet (app-chakra-modal.component.ts):**\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-chakra-modal',\n  templateUrl: './chakra-modal.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./chakra-modal.component.scss']\n})\nexport class ChakraModalComponent {\n  @Input() isOpen: boolean = false;\n  @Input() title: string = '';\n  @Input() message: string = '';\n  @Output() confirm = new EventEmitter<void>();\n  @Output() cancel = new EventEmitter<void>();\n\n  onConfirm() {\n    this.confirm.emit();\n  }\n\n  onCancel() {\n    this.cancel.emit();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Code Example Snippet (app-chakra-modal.component.html):**\n\n```html\n<chakra-modal [isOpen]=\"isOpen\">\n  <chakra-modal-overlay />\n  <chakra-modal-content>\n    <chakra-modal-header>{{ title }}</chakra-modal-header>\n    <chakra-modal-close-button />\n    <chakra-modal-body>\n      {{ message }}\n    </chakra-modal-body>\n\n    <chakra-modal-footer>\n      <chakra-button colorScheme=\"blue\" mr={3} (click)=\"onConfirm()\">\n        Confirm\n      </chakra-button>\n      <chakra-button variant=\"ghost\" (click)=\"onCancel()\">Cancel</chakra-button>\n    </chakra-modal-footer>\n  </chakra-modal-content>\n</chakra-modal>\n```\n\n## 🎨 Design System Implementation\n\nThe Chakra UI Modal component aligns with the modern brand personality and accessibility requirements. The detected color system utilizes #309694 and #ffffff. Ensure these colors are consistent with the design system tokens. The typography uses the Inter font, and font sizes should adhere to the established typographic scale. Spacing should follow the defined spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px) for consistent visual rhythm. Confirm that all styles are pulled from the central style guide and adhere to existing theming configurations to maintain a unified look and feel across the application. Special attention should be given to contrast ratios for text and interactive elements to meet accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA).\n\n## ✅ Intelligence-Driven Acceptance Criteria\n\n*   **Functionality:** The modal should open and close correctly when triggered. The confirm and cancel actions should emit the appropriate events.\n*   **Accessibility:** The modal must be fully keyboard accessible. Focus must be trapped within the modal when open. ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) should be used appropriately. The modal should meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.\n*   **Responsiveness:** The modal should adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.\n*   **Performance:** The modal should not negatively impact page load time or rendering performance. Lazy loading may be considered if the modal contains complex content.\n*   **Design System Compliance:** The modal should adhere to the design system's visual styles and spacing guidelines.\n\n## 🔧 Development Strategy & Implementation\n\n1.  **Component Structure:** Create a reusable Angular component that encapsulates the Chakra UI Modal functionality.\n2.  **Input Properties:** Define input properties for modal title, message, and button labels.\n3.  **Output Events:** Define output events for confirm and cancel actions.\n4.  **Accessibility:** Implement keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for accessibility.\n5.  **Testing:** Write unit tests to verify component functionality and accessibility. Write end-to-end tests to verify integration with the application.\n\n**Time Estimate:** 24 hours\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n\n*   **Chakra UI Version Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility between the Chakra UI Angular components and the Angular version used in the project.\n*   **Accessibility Compliance:** Thoroughly test the modal for accessibility compliance using automated tools and manual testing.\n*   **Performance Optimization:** Monitor the modal's performance and optimize as needed.\n\n**Testing Strategy:**\n\n*   **Unit Tests:** Verify component functionality and accessibility.\n*   **End-to-End Tests:** Verify integration with the application.\n*   **Accessibility Tests:** Use automated tools and manual testing to ensure accessibility compliance.\n\n## 📊 Success Measurement & Validation\n\n*   **Business Metrics:** Track the usage of the modal in different contexts to identify areas for improvement.\n*   **Technical KPIs:** Monitor the modal's performance (e.g., load time, rendering time).\n*   **User Experience Validation:** Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the modal's usability and accessibility. Analyze user feedback to identify areas for improvement.",

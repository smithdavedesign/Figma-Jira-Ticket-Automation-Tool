      "aiResponse": "# 🎯 Executive Summary & Business Context\nThis ticket outlines the implementation of a Material Design Button component within an AEM environment. The button serves as a crucial interactive element, enabling users to trigger actions and navigate the user journey. Its correct implementation is vital for enhancing user engagement and achieving conversion goals, impacting key business metrics. This aligns with standard business models requiring clear calls to action and intuitive user interfaces.\n\n## 🏢 Business Requirements & User Context\nThe button addresses a common business need: facilitating user interaction and guiding them towards desired actions (e.g., submitting forms, navigating to different pages, initiating processes). User personas will expect a recognizable, easily clickable button with clear visual feedback upon interaction. The business model relies on users being able to easily initiate these actions, so a clear and reliable button is necessary for a good user experience and increased conversions. The button's design should align with industry-standard practices for button appearance and functionality, promoting user familiarity and reducing cognitive load.\n\n## 👤 User Experience Strategy\nThe Material Design Button aims to provide a familiar and intuitive user experience. Given that it’s a click handler component, the user experience should aim to minimize cognitive load. This can be done by leveraging visual cues and clear labels. We should ensure consistent placement and styling of buttons across the AEM site. Since it might be a multistep user journey, we also need to consider where the button is placed and what action occurs after the button is clicked. The button should provide clear visual feedback (e.g., hover state, active state) upon interaction, reassuring users that their action is registered.\n\n## 📋 Technical Analysis & Architecture\nThe implementation will follow AEM best practices, leveraging Sling Models and HTL templating. Due to the medium-high implementation complexity, a reusable AEM component will be created.\n\n1.  **Component Structure:** The component will consist of an HTL template, a Sling Model (Java class) for data retrieval and logic, and a client library for CSS styling and JavaScript functionality (if needed).\n\n2.  **Data Handling:** The Sling Model will expose properties such as button label, link URL, target attribute, and styling options. These properties will be configurable through the AEM authoring interface.\n\n3.  **Accessibility:** ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`) will be added to enhance accessibility. Keyboard navigation will be fully supported.\n\n4.  **Client Libraries:** A dedicated client library will handle the button's styling and any necessary JavaScript interactions (e.g., handling click events, tracking analytics).\n\n5.  **Considerations:**\n    *   AEM Style System can be used to provide further customization of button appearance.\n    *   If the button is part of a form, proper form submission handling should be implemented.\n\n## 🎨 Design System Implementation\nThe Material Design Button implementation must adhere to the established design system. This includes:\n\n1.  **Color Palette:** Use the designated color tokens for button background, text, and hover/active states. The extracted colors #1a75d1 (Component fill 1) and #ffffff (Component fill 2) should be mapped to the corresponding design tokens.\n\n2.  **Typography:** Utilize the Roboto font family with a 14px font size, adhering to the defined typography hierarchy.\n\n3.  **Spacing:** Maintain consistent spacing using the defined patterns (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px).\n\n4.  **Responsive Behavior:** Implement responsive styling to ensure the button renders correctly across different screen sizes. Media queries within the client library will control size, spacing, and potentially text wrapping.\n\n5.  **Component Variations:** Consider supporting different button variations (e.g., primary, secondary, outlined) through the AEM Style System. Each variation should be mapped to specific design tokens for styling.\n\n## ✅ Intelligence-Driven Acceptance Criteria\n1.  The button must render correctly across all supported browsers and devices.\n2.  The button must be fully accessible, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.\n3.  The button's styling must align perfectly with the design system specifications.\n4.  Clicking the button should trigger the expected action (e.g., navigating to the correct URL, submitting the form).\n5.  The button should provide clear visual feedback upon hover and click.\n6.  The component should be configurable through the AEM authoring interface.\n7.  Page load performance should not be negatively impacted by the button's implementation. Load time should remain within acceptable limits.\n8.  The button should be properly integrated into the existing AEM component library.\n9.  Component should adhere to all coding standards and AEM best practices.\n\n## 🔧 Development Strategy & Implementation\n1.  **Code Architecture:** The AEM component will be developed using HTL, Sling Models, and client libraries.\n2.  **Time Estimates:** Implementation is estimated to take 24 hours.\n3.  **Risk Mitigation:** Ensure careful handling of URLs and security considerations related to button links. Proper error handling should be in place for unexpected scenarios.\n4.  **Testing Strategy:** Unit tests will be created for the Sling Model. Functional tests will be performed to verify the button's behavior and accessibility. AEM Real Screenshot Test will be used for visual verification.\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n*   Create the AEM component structure (HTL template, Sling Model, client library).\n*   Implement the Sling Model to retrieve button properties from the AEM authoring interface.\n*   Develop the HTL template to render the button with the retrieved properties.\n*   Implement the client library to apply the necessary CSS styling and JavaScript functionality.\n*   Implement the AEM Real Screenshot Test to ensure pixel-perfect implementation as per designs.\n*   Thoroughly test the component across different browsers and devices.\n*   Address any accessibility issues identified during testing.\n*   Integrate the component into the AEM component library.\n*   Document the component's usage and configuration.\n\n## 📊 Success Measurement & Validation\n1.  **Business Metrics:** Track click-through rates and conversion rates associated with the button.\n2.  **Technical KPIs:** Monitor page load times and component rendering performance.\n3.  **User Experience Validation:** Conduct user testing to assess the button's usability and effectiveness.

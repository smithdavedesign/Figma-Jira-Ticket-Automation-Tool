The Material Design Button should be readily identifiable as an interactive element. Clear visual cues like hover states and click animations will reinforce its functionality. Considering a multi-step user journey, buttons should be strategically placed to guide users through the desired path towards conversion. For example, in a product checkout flow, the “Continue to Payment” button should be prominent and easily accessible. Accessibility is paramount. The button must be keyboard navigable, have sufficient color contrast, and provide alternative text for screen readers. This is critical to a positive and inclusive user experience.\n\n## 📋 Technical Analysis & Architecture\n\nThe implementation strategy for this Material Design Button in AEM involves leveraging the AEM component framework. The component complexity is rated as medium-high due to the need for incorporating various states (default, hover, active, disabled), handling click events, and ensuring accessibility. The component architecture should follow the best practices for AEM component development, including separation of concerns (content, presentation, and logic). This involves creating a Sling model to manage the component's data, a HTL template for rendering the markup, and a client-side JavaScript library for handling interactivity and state management. A design dialog will be implemented to allow content authors to configure the button’s appearance (e.g., text, color, size, icon).\n\n## 🎨 Design System Implementation\n\nThis Material Design Button will adhere strictly to our design system to maintain brand consistency and cohesiveness. The color system utilizes `#1a75d1` as the primary fill color and `#ffffff` as the secondary fill color. Typography will be based on the Roboto font family, with a font size of 14px for the button label. The component's layout and spacing must conform to the established design system grid and spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px). Responsive behavior is critical; the button must adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. The implementation will leverage design tokens for colors, typography, and spacing to ensure maintainability and scalability. Styles will be modularized and follow a BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention.\n\n## ✅ Intelligence-Driven Acceptance Criteria\n\nThe following acceptance criteria must be met to ensure the successful implementation of the Material Design Button:\n\n*   **Visual Fidelity:** The button must visually match the design specifications and screenshots provided across all supported browsers and devices.\n*   **Functionality:** The button must correctly trigger the intended action upon clicking or tapping.\n*   **Accessibility:** The button must be fully accessible to users with disabilities, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Material Design Button Component Implementation\n\nThis ticket defines the implementation of a Material Design Button component within AEM. This component provides a consistent and accessible way for users to trigger actions within the application. The implementation will adhere to Material Design principles and best practices for AEM development. This ensures a modern, user-friendly experience.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy:*\n\nWe will implement this component using the AEM HTL templating language and Sling Models for backend logic. The component will be built as a fully configurable AEM component, allowing authors to customize the button's text, link, color (using the defined color system), and size.\n\n*Component Architecture:*\n\nThe component will consist of the following:\n*   *HTL Template:* Renders the button's HTML structure, using attributes provided by the Sling Model.\n*   *Sling Model (Java):* Provides the data for the HTL template, including the button text, link, and styling options.\n*   *Client Libraries (CSS/JS):* Implements the visual styling, hover states, and click handling for the button.  We'll use BEM naming conventions for CSS classes.\n\n*Data Flow:*\n\n1.  Content Authors configure the button's properties in the AEM authoring environment.\n2.  These properties are stored in the AEM JCR repository.\n3.  When the page is rendered, the Sling Model reads the properties from the JCR.\n4.  The Sling Model makes the data available to the HTL template.\n5.  The HTL template renders the HTML for the button.\n6.  Client libraries apply the visual styling and handle user interactions.\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System:*\n\nThe component will integrate seamlessly with the existing design system by utilizing the defined color system (#1a75d1 and #ffffff) and Roboto font family. CSS variables will be used to maintain consistency and allow for easy theming in the future. The spacing patterns (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px) will be enforced.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations:*\n\n*   *Performance:* The component's CSS and JavaScript will be optimized for performance. We will leverage AEM's client library management system to ensure that the necessary resources are loaded efficiently.\n*   *Accessibility:* The component will be accessible to users with disabilities. This includes providing appropriate ARIA attributes, ensuring keyboard navigability, and meeting WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Specifically, the `aria-label` attribute should be configurable via the AEM authoring dialog, and the button element will use proper semantic HTML.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values:*\n*   Primary Color: #1a75d1\n*   Text Color (on Primary): #ffffff (or derived based on contrast ratio requirements)\n\n*Typography:*\n*   Font Family: Roboto\n*   Font Size: 14px (Consider offering options for different sizes via the AEM authoring dialog, using a type scale that aligns with the design system)\n\n*Spacing:*\n*   Internal Spacing (Padding): We need to determine specific padding based on button state (default, hover, active). This isn't visible from the single screenshot. Likely combinations of the 4px, 8px values are to be used.\n\n*Interactive States:*\n\n*   *Hover State:* A subtle visual change to indicate that the button is interactive. This could be a slight background color change or a shadow effect. We'll need specifications for the hover state visual.\n*   *Active State:* A visual change to indicate that the button is being clicked.  This will likely involve a darker background color and/or a slight inset shadow. We'll need specifications for the active state visual.\n*   *Disabled State:* A visual state indicating that the button is not interactive. This should include a greyed-out appearance and a disabled cursor. The `disabled` attribute should be dynamically applied.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n*Functional Requirements:*\n\n*   The button must correctly navigate to the specified URL when clicked.\n*   The button must display the correct text, as configured by the content author.\n*   The button must have appropriate hover, active, and disabled states.\n*   When the button is disabled, it should not be clickable.\n*   The button's link can be configured to open in a new tab/window.\n\n*Visual Accuracy Requirements:*\n\n*   The button must use the correct color values.\n*   The button must use the correct font family and size.\n*   The button must have the correct spacing.\n*   The button must match the visual design specifications for all states (default, hover, active, disabled).\n*   The button renders correctly in all supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n\n*Performance Benchmarks:*\n\n*   The button should load quickly and not impact page load time.\n*   The button's interactive states should be responsive and not cause any noticeable lag.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization and File Structure:*\n\n{{/apps/<project>/components/material-button}}\n{{/apps/<project>/components/material-button/material-button.html}} (HTL Template)\n{{/apps/<project>/components/material-button/MaterialButton.java}} (Sling Model)\n{{/apps/<project>/components/material-button/clientlibs/css/material-button.css}} (CSS)\n{{/apps/<project>/components/material-button/clientlibs/js/material-button.js}} (JS - if needed)\n{{/apps/<project>/components/material-button/_cq_dialog/.content.xml}} (AEM Authoring Dialog)\n\n*Testing Strategy:*\n\n*   *Unit Tests:* Test the Sling Model's logic.\n*   *Component Tests:* Test the rendering of the HTL template with different data inputs.\n*   *UI Tests:* Verify the visual appearance and interactive behavior of the component in a browser. (Selenium, Cypress).  Consider AEM's screenshot testing capabilities.\n*   *Accessibility Tests:* Use automated tools and manual testing to ensure that the component meets accessibility standards.\n\n*Potential Gotchas and Implementation Challenges:*\n\n*   *CSS Specificity:* Be mindful of CSS specificity when applying styles to the button. Use BEM naming conventions to avoid conflicts with other styles on the page.\n*   *Cross-Browser Compatibility:* Test the component in all supported browsers to ensure consistent rendering and behavior.\n*   *Accessibility:*  Proper ARIA attribute usage is essential for screen reader compatibility.\n*   *Contrast Ratios:* Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.  Consider a configurable contrast check within the authoring dialog to alert authors to potential accessibility issues.\n*   *Touch Devices:*  Ensure hover effects translate well to touch interactions. Consider providing alternative visual feedback for touch devices.\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Bootstrap Card Component Implementation\n\nThis ticket outlines the development of a reusable Bootstrap Card component in React TypeScript. The card serves as a container for displaying content in a structured manner, adhering to the established design system. This component promotes consistency and reusability across the application. The \"B\" logo suggests this card may be a branding element or part of an index of Bootstrap-related components, meaning clarity in its purpose and implementation is paramount.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Implementation Strategy*: We will use React TypeScript to create a `BootstrapCard` component. The component should be flexible enough to accept various content types as children. We will leverage existing styling solutions (e.g., Styled Components or CSS modules) to ensure consistency with the design system.\n\n*Component Architecture*: The `BootstrapCard` component will be a functional component accepting props for customization.  The internal structure will consist of a wrapping `<div>` element (representing the card itself) with children passed directly through.  If titles, subtitles or footers are to be included within the card, slots (or prop-based rendering) will be used to provide flexibility.\n\n*Data Flow*:  The component will primarily receive data via props.  We anticipate props for controlling background color, text color, border styles and any other design-related variations. The 'B' graphic itself may be either an inline SVG (for maximum styling control) or an `<img>` tag with a dynamically provided `src` prop.\n\n*Integration with Existing Design System*:  The component will utilize predefined color variables and typography styles from our design system to maintain visual consistency.  We'll enforce these through TypeScript interfaces for type safety.  Specifically, the colors `#f7fafa` and `#212629` will be incorporated as theme options.\n\n*Performance and Accessibility Considerations*:  The component should be lightweight and avoid unnecessary re-renders.  We'll use `React.memo` where appropriate to optimize performance.  Regarding accessibility, we will ensure proper ARIA attributes are used to provide semantic meaning and improve usability for users with disabilities. We must consider adding appropriate `role` attributes if the card has a specific function on the page (e.g. `role=\"article\"`).\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Values*:\n* Component Fill 1: `#f7fafa`\n* Component Fill 2: `#212629`\n\n*Typography*: The component will inherit the `system-ui` font. Specific styling (font-weight, size) will be determined by the context in which the card is used. We need clarification on the exact usage of Primary, Secondary and Caption typography hierarchy. We will default to:\n*Primary*: 16px, Bold\n*Secondary*: 16px, Normal\n*Caption*: 12px, Normal (or as visually appropriate)\n\n*Spacing Measurements*: The design system suggests a spacing scale of 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px.  Padding within the card will adhere to this scale, ensuring consistent spacing between elements.  Specifically, we should experiment with padding values of 16px and 24px for a balanced visual appearance. The curve radius of the card's corners is not provided but appears to be approximately 8px. This needs verification from the designers. The \"B\" icon needs adequate spacing around it.\n\n*Responsive Behavior*: The card should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. We'll utilize CSS media queries or a responsive grid system to ensure proper layout on various devices. The card's width should scale fluidly within its container.\n\n*Interactive States*: The visual analysis does not indicate specific interactive states (e.g., hover, focus).  We will need to clarify if the card should have any interactive effects.  If so, we will add subtle visual cues to indicate interactivity.  For accessibility, a focus state is essential.\n\n*The 'B' Logo*: The purple 'B' logo needs to be handled carefully. It's crucial to determine:\n* *Is it always purple, or should the colour be configurable?*\n* *What is the intended interaction with it?* Does it lead to a landing page?\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)\n\n*Functional Requirements*:\n* The component renders correctly with provided children.\n* The component accepts props for customizing background color, text color, and border styles.\n* The component is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.\n* If interactive states are specified, they function as expected.\n\n*Visual Accuracy Requirements*:\n* The component matches the visual design in terms of colors, typography, and spacing.\n* The component aligns with the design system guidelines.\n* The card's corner radius matches the design specification (awaiting clarification).\n* The `B` logo is displayed correctly and matches the design.\n\n*Performance Benchmarks*:\n* The component renders efficiently without causing performance bottlenecks.\n* The component avoids unnecessary re-renders.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization*:\n* Create a `BootstrapCard` component in a dedicated directory (e.g., `src/components/BootstrapCard`).\n* Create a `BootstrapCard.tsx` file for the component implementation.\n* Create a `BootstrapCard.module.css` (or use Styled Components) for styling.\n* Create a `BootstrapCard.types.tsx` file to define props interface.\n* Include unit tests for component functionality.\n\n*Testing Strategy*:\n* Write unit tests to verify the component's rendering and functionality.\n* Use snapshot testing to ensure visual consistency.\n* Conduct end-to-end tests to validate the component's integration with other parts of the application.\n\n*Potential Gotchas*:\n* Ensuring proper handling of different content types within the card.\n* Maintaining visual consistency across different browsers and devices.\n* Optimizing performance to avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n* Getting exact specification of colours.\n* Accessibility considerations, especially focus states and ARIA attributes.\n* Ensuring the B logo is rendered with appropriate size and resolution across different screen densities. Consider using an SVG to ensure it scales well.\n\nh2. 🧩 Further Questions\n\n* *What is the click-through behaviour of the card?* Where should a click on the 'B' logo or the entire card direct the user?\n* *What are all the allowable colours of the 'B' logo?*\n* *Is there a 'disabled' state of the card?*\n* *What ARIA roles should be applied to the component and its contents?*\n* *Are there specific accessibility keyboard navigation requirements to be aware of?*\n\n---\n",

      "aiResponse": "h1. 🎯 Implement Chakra UI Modal Component\n\nThis ticket outlines the implementation of a Chakra UI Modal component in our Angular application. The modal provides a focused overlay for critical user interactions, ensuring clarity and preventing distractions from the main interface. This component will be used across various sections of the application, requiring reusability and adherence to our design system. Proper implementation will improve user experience and maintain consistent visual language.\n\nh2. 📋 Technical Analysis & Approach\n\n*Angular Implementation Strategy*:\n  * We'll create a reusable Angular component that wraps the Chakra UI `Modal` component.\n  * The component will accept input properties for configuration (title, content, buttons, etc.) and emit events for user actions (e.g., confirmation, cancellation).\n  * Consider implementing the `OnPush` change detection strategy for performance optimization.\n\n*Component Architecture & Data Flow*:\n  * The component will receive data via `@Input` properties.\n  * Events like modal open, close, confirm, and cancel will be emitted via `@Output` properties.\n  *  A service could be used to manage the modal's visibility state if it's triggered from multiple unrelated components. This could be implemented with a RxJS `BehaviorSubject` for a single source of truth.\n\n*Design System Integration*:\n  * Leverage existing Chakra UI themes and styling tokens for consistency.\n  * Ensure the modal's styling matches the application's overall design system.\n  * Create custom Chakra UI themes if needed to accommodate specific design requirements.\n\n*Performance Considerations*:\n  * Ensure the modal content is only rendered when the modal is visible using `*ngIf`.\n  * If the modal contains complex components, consider lazy loading them.\n\n*Accessibility Considerations*:\n  * Use appropriate ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility (e.g., `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`).\n  * Implement keyboard navigation for accessibility. Ensure focus is trapped within the modal when it's open.\n\nh2. 🎨 Design Implementation Details\n\n*Color Palette*:\n  * Component Fill 1: #309694 (teal-500 - name inferred based on color value)\n  * Component Fill 2: #FFFFFF (white)\n  * We'll use Chakra UI's color tokens to ensure consistency. For example, the teal color would map to something like `theme.colors.teal[500]`\n\n*Typography*:\n  * Font Family: Inter (Use the appropriate Chakra UI theme token for font family)\n  * Font Sizes:  Adapt font sizes based on the specific modal content and header hierarchy (16px is the base font size).  Title could be 20px (using `heading` variant), body at 16px (using `body` variant)\n  * Ensure proper contrast ratios for readability.\n\n*Layout & Spacing*:\n  * Use consistent spacing based on the 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px pattern.\n  * Leverage Chakra UI's `Stack` and `Box` components for flexible layouts.\n  * Use theme spacing tokens: `theme.space[4]`, `theme.space[8]`, etc.\n\n*Interactive States*:\n  * Consider hover and focus states for interactive elements (buttons, links). Use Chakra UI's `_hover` and `_focus` pseudo-selectors for this.\n  * Handle disabled states appropriately.\n\n*Responsive Behavior*:\n  * The modal should adapt to different screen sizes. Consider using Chakra UI's responsive styles (`@media` queries or array-based syntax).\n  * The modal should be centered on the screen, even on smaller devices.\n\nh2. ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n*Functional Requirements*:\n  * The modal should open and close correctly when triggered.\n  * Data passed to the modal via `@Input` properties should be displayed correctly.\n  * Events emitted by the modal (e.g., confirm, cancel) should be handled by the parent component.\n  * Focus should be trapped within the modal when it's open.\n  * The close button (if any) should close the modal.\n  * The modal should be dismissable by pressing the \"Escape\" key.\n  * The modal backdrop should prevent interaction with the underlying page.\n\n*Visual Accuracy*:\n  * The modal's styling (colors, fonts, spacing) should match the design specifications.\n  * The modal should be centered on the screen.\n  * The modal should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.\n  * The backdrop should have the correct opacity and color.\n\n*Accessibility*:\n  * The modal should be accessible to users with disabilities.\n  * ARIA attributes should be used correctly for screen reader compatibility.\n  * Keyboard navigation should be implemented.\n\n*Performance*:\n  * The modal should open and close smoothly without noticeable lag.\n  * The modal should not cause performance issues on the main application.\n\nh2. 🔧 Development Guidance\n\n*Code Organization*:\n  * Create a dedicated Angular component for the modal (e.g., `app-chakra-modal`).\n  * Separate the component's logic from its presentation using a container/presentational component pattern if necessary.\n  * Create a separate module for the modal component and export it.\n\n*Testing Strategy*:\n  * Write unit tests to verify the component's logic.\n  * Write integration tests to verify the component's interaction with other components.\n  * Use end-to-end tests (e.g., Cypress) to test the modal's functionality in a real browser. Specifically pay attention to accessibility tests.\n\n*Potential Gotchas*:\n  * Ensure proper focus management when the modal opens and closes.\n  * Be careful when using animations to avoid accessibility issues.\n  * Test the modal on different browsers and devices.\n  * Ensure that the modal content doesn't overflow on smaller screens.\n\n*Implementation Challenges*:\n  * Managing modal state in a complex application. Using a shared service with RxJS might be a good approach.\n  * Ensuring the modal is accessible to all users. Requires careful attention to ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.\n  * Optimizing performance if the modal contains complex components. Lazy loading and virtual scrolling might be necessary.\n",

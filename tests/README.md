## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide - CONSOLIDATED COMMANDS**

### **📋 AI ASSISTANT RULES FOR TESTING**
1. **DO NOT CREATE NEW TEST SCRIPTS** - Use existing 8-command structure only
2. **INTEGRATE WITH ULTIMATE SUITE** - Add tests to `tests/integration/test-consolidated-suite.html`
3. **USE MASTER ORCHESTRATORS** - Leverage `scripts/test-orchestrator.js` and related scripts
4. **NO INDIVIDUAL npm SCRIPTS** - Follow consolidated command structure
5. **UPDATE CONSOLIDATED DOCS** - Changes only to `docs/testing/` directory

### **🎯 New Simplified Testing Workflow:**
1. **Unit Tests:** `npm test` (Fast vitest unit tests - 12 tests in ~120ms)
2. **System Health:** `npm run health` (30s comprehensive system check)
3. **All Tests:** `npm run test:all` (Comprehensive orchestrated testing)
4. **Monitor System:** `npm run monitor` (Live monitoring dashboard)
5. **Browser Tests:** `npm run test:browser` (Smoke + full browser testing)
6. **Visual Interface:** `npm run test:suite` (Ultimate Test Suite with 9 tabs)

### **✅ Essential Commands (8 TOTAL - 65% Reduction):**
```bash
# 🚀 TIER 1: Daily Development Commands
npm test                    # Vitest unit tests (fastest - 12 tests)
npm run test:suite         # Ultimate Test Suite (visual interface)
npm run test:all           # Comprehensive orchestrated testing
npm run health             # System health check (30s)
npm run monitor            # Live monitoring dashboard
npm run test:watch         # Development mode with file watching
npm run test:coverage      # Coverage reports with Vitest
npm run validate           # Full validation (test + build)

# 🎯 TIER 2: Specialized Commands
npm run test:browser       # Browser compatibility (smoke tests)
npm run test:templates     # Template system validation

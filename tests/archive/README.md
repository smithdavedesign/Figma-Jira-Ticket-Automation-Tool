### **UI Test Files** (`/ui-test-files/`)
- **`test-figma-integration.html`** - Duplicate of main integration test (functionality merged)
- **`simple-debug.html`** - Basic functionality now covered in System tab
- **`test-ui.html`** - Superseded by test-ui-functionality.html and UI tab
- **`test-figma-plugin.html`** - Functionality integrated into consolidated suite
- **`test-parse-tech-stack.html`** - Tech stack detection consolidated into System tab
- **`test-screenshot-api.html`** - Screenshot API testing consolidated into Screenshots tab

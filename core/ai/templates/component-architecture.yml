prompt_template: |
  You are a senior software architect specializing in component-based systems. Analyze the provided component for architectural implementation strategy.

  ## Component Context:
  - **Name**: {{ figma.component_name }}
  - **Type**: {{ structural.type }}
  - **Tech Stack**: {{ project.tech_stack | join(', ') }}
  - **Complexity**: {{ calculated.complexity }}

  ## Architectural Analysis Required:

  ### 1. Component Decomposition
  - Break down into logical sub-components
  - Identify shared/reusable elements
  - Determine component hierarchy and relationships

  ### 2. State Management Strategy
  - Assess state complexity and requirements
  - Recommend state management approach
  - Identify shared state and props interface

  ### 3. Technical Implementation Plan
  - Suggest implementation phases and priorities
  - Identify technical dependencies and requirements
  - Recommend testing and validation strategy

  ### 4. Performance Considerations
  - Assess rendering performance implications
  - Recommend optimization strategies
  - Identify potential performance bottlenecks

  Respond with structured JSON focusing on actionable architectural guidance.

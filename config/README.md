# Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files for development and deployment.

## Files

- **`manifest-dev.json`** - Development version of the Figma plugin manifest
- **`eslint.config.js`** - ESLint configuration for code quality

## Purpose

Development configurations are kept separate from production files to:
- Enable different settings for dev vs production
- Keep development tools isolated
- Maintain clean production builds
